> Before you set out to create and send WhatsApp messages, kindly make sure you have your WhatsApp Service Provider (WSP) setup and add the Whitelisted Message Template.
> 
> To know how to set up WSP and add templates, kindly refer to the _WhatsApp Integration_ guide.

Your dashboard comes with a highly intuitive campaign creation interface that makes it easy to execute highly personalized campaigns in minutes!

Now, let's walk you through the campaign creation process.

Create Campaigns


--------------------

As shown below, the campaign creation interface can be accessed by clicking the _Plus icon_ placed on the top left of the central hub of WhatsApp. In doing so, you will be prompted to select the type of campaign you'd like to create.

Click to enlarge

### 

Camapign Type

Let's quickly walk you through each campaign type:

#### 

One-time

These are stand-alone messages that are sent to your users only once and generally comprise time-bound offers. These campaigns end as soon s they are delivered to the target audience.

#### 

Triggered

These are ongoing cycles of communication sent to only those users of your target audience who perform a particular event on your app/website.

#### 

Recurring

These are ongoing cycles of communication that are scheduled to be sent periodically to its target audience. Such campaigns help you automate communication for several recurring events in your user's lifecycle like _subscription renewals, policy renewals, bill payments, recurring investments_ and so on.

#### 

Transactional

These are highly contextual messages that your users expect to receive while interacting with your brand through your app, website, or offline. This could be acknowledging user interactions like sign up (welcome newsletter), password reset, payment confirmation (invoice), order confirmation, and so on.

Audience


------------

This is where you set the basic details for your campaign like name, audience type, and so on.

### 

Campaign Name

The first step is to give your campaign a unique name that helps you identify its purpose.

Click to enlarge

### 

Campaign Tags (Optional)

Tag is a handy feature that helps you categorize your campaigns as per their purpose, target audience, frequency, or any other parameter that makes them easier to search for. Tags also help you analyze campaign results for a group of campaigns that belong to a tag.

Click to enlarge

### 

Audience Type

One of the key differentiators of successful campaigns is that they're tailored to the behavior and preferences of a specific group of users. Thus, by selecting an _Audience Type,_ you can choose to target a specific segment of users or combine several segments to define your _WhatsApp campaign's_ audience.

> 🚧
> --
> 
> **Quick Read:** Segmenting opted-in WhatsApp Users

**As shown below:**

Click to enlarge

*   Select **Send to users in single segment** to target all users who are included within a particular segment.
    
*   Select **Send to users in multiple segments and/or don't send to users in certain segments** to narrow down the audience to a very specific user persona, defined by including and excluding several segments from the target audience.
    

### 

Send To

Depending on the option you selected in _Audience Type_, the answer may vary.  
Here's how you can set up each _Audience Type_:

#### 

1\. If **_'Send to users in single segment'_** is selected as **_'Audience Type'_**

As shown below, click the dropdown nested beside _Send To,_ to specify the target segment.

Click to enlarge

Let's quickly walk you through **Segment Preview:**

*   **Reachable Users:** Indicates the number of users from the selected segment that can be engaged through _WhatsApp_ as a channel at present.
    
*   **Rules of Segmentation:** You can choose to segment your entire user base by 3 broad parameters - _User (attributes), Behavior_ and _Technology._ Thus, _Segment Preview_ presents a snapshot of all the users against the parameters based on which they have been grouped.
    

Detailed Read on Segments.

##### 

2\. If **_'Send to users in multiple segments and/or don't send to users in certain segments'_** is selected as **_'Audience Type'_**

**When you want to _Include_ a set of target audience:**

Using multiple segments to define the target audience is an excellent way to target users who have similar preferences, belong to the same location, or perform certain actions on your app/website without creating a new segment.

Here's how you can go about it:

*   Step 1: Select a Condition
    
    *   Select **Users in ANY of these segments** to send the campaign to all the users included within each segment.
        
    *   Select **Users in ALL of these segments** to send the campaign only to those users who are shared by all the segments.
        
*   Step 2: Select a Segment
    
*   Step 3: Click Add Segment to select another one.
    

Click to enlarge

For example, in the above visual, we have selected _Users in ALL of these segments._ This means that the campaign will be sent to only users included within all three segments at any given point in time. Users who are a part of 2 or fewer segments will not receive the message.

**When you want to _Exclude_ a set of target audience:**

You can choose to exclude a segment or multiple segments from the target audience by configuring the field, _Don't Send To._ This is a great way to engage users that match a specific persona selectively.

Here's how you can go about it:

*   Step 1: Select a Condition\*\*
    
    *   Select **Users in ANY of these segments** to prevent users in each segment from receiving the campaign.
        
    *   Select **Users in ALL of these segments** to prevent only those users from receiving the campaign that is common between all the segments.
        
*   Step 2: Select a Segment
    
*   Step 3: Click Add Segment to select another one.

> When Segment Isn't Specified Under the field, 'Send To'
> 
> 
> -------------------------------------------------------------
> 
> By default, a campaign is set to be delivered to _All Users._ Thus, if no segment is selected under _Send To_ AND segments are specified under _Exclude Users from These Segments,_ then _the campaign will be sent to all the users who are reachable on WhatsApp AND are not included within the specified segments._

WebEngage allows you to Edit and Create New Segments while creating campaigns.

**Edit Segment**  
Click on the _Edit icon,_ placed towards the right of the dropdown to edit the selected _Segment._ In doing so, you will be prompted by a pop-up, pre-populated with the existing segmentation rules, as shown below.

Make your edits and click _Save_ to proceed. In doing so, you will preview the number of reachable users as per your edits.

Click to enlarge

**Create a New Segment**

You can create a new _Segment \_of users by clicking the \_Plus icon_ placed towards the right of the dropdown. In doing so, you will be prompted by a pop-up, allowing you to build a new segment, as shown below.

Once created, you will be able to access the _Segment_ through the _List of Segments_ and while creating a campaign/journey.

Click to enlarge

**Create a New, Single-use Segment**

You can create disposable segments or segment users specifically for the campaign and avoid adding it to the _List of Segments_ in your dashboard. This can be achieved by leaving the field _Name_ blank while creating the segment. In doing so, it will become an _Ad hoc segment_ in your dashboard, which will be available only for sending the campaign you're currently creating.

Click to enlarge

##### 

Remove Duplicates

For _One-Time_ and _Recurring_ campaigns, _Remove Duplicates_ option will automatically ensure that a particular phone number doesn't receive any _WhatsApp_ campaign multiple times if your project has multiple users with the same phone number.

Click to enlarge

If multiple users have the same phone number (as shown in the example below), WebEngage will only pick one of these users while sending the campaign.

Click to enlarge

> 📘
> 
> Please Note
> 
> 
> -----------------
> 
> _Remove Duplicates_ option will be enabled by default for new campaigns created. However, you can disable it manually as per your campaign's requirement.

> This is a conditional option which will be shown only if the you have created Universal control group in your account. Click here to know how to create Universal control group.

click to enlarge

*   **When the box is checked**, the campaign will not be sent to users who are part of the Universal Control Group in the segment that is selected.
*   **When the box is unchecked**, the campaign will be sent to all users that are part of the segment inclusive of the Universal Control Group users.

When to Send


----------------

This step of campaign creation allows you to:

*   Specify when and how often you'd like the target audience to receive the _WhatsApp._
*   Manage the role your campaign plays in your overall engagement strategy.

Hence, _When_ has been divided into two sections:

*   Campaign Schedule
*   Frequency Capping, Throttling & DND

Let's get you acquainted with the workings of each:

### 

Campaign Schedule

Click to enlarge

Here you can specify **when and how often** the target audience should receive your campaign. This can be determined by configuring the _Campaign Type_ selected when you initiated campaign creation.

*   One-Time
*   Triggered
*   Recurring

Here's how you can go about it:

**One-time Campaign**

Click to enlarge

*   **Step 1:** Specify the _Delivery Time_. You can choose to send the campaign _Now_ or _Later_ at the selected date and time.
    
*   **Step 2:** If _Later_ is selected, you can send messages per each user's timezone by selecting _In User's Timezone_ from the last dropdown!  
    You can choose from the 2 options i.e. _Send Intelligently_ or to send at a specific time.
    
    *   **Send Intelligently**: optimizes campaign send-time for each user, our system intelligently decides the best time to send a campaign based on your user’s interactions with past campaigns of each channel. Click here to know more.
    *   **Send at Specific Time**: You can specify the time at which you would like to send your campaign to your users, either from the _users time zone_ or the campaign's _project time zone_.

**Triggered Campaign**

Click to enlarge

*   **Step 1:** As shown above, select the event _Upon the Occurrence_ of which the campaign will be triggered or sent to the user.
    
*   **Step 2:** (Optional): Add _Attribute Filters_ to the _Event_ by clicking the filter icon. Further, you can choose to club multiple event attributes by the _AND/OR logic_ to define the scope of occurrence of the event.
    

Click to enlarge

*   **Step 3:** Specify the Delivery Time of the triggered campaign  
    As shown in the below:
    *   _Select **Send as soon as the event occurs** to deliver the campaign immediately_
    *   _Select **Wait for (duration) and then send** to deliver the campaign after sometime_
    *   You can set up a wait time in _Minutes, Hours or Weeks_, after which the campaign will be sent to the respective users

Click to enlarge

*   **Step 4:** Specify the _Start Date_ or the date-time on which the triggered campaign should start getting delivered to the target audience. You can choose to send the campaign _Now_ or _Later_ at the selected date and time.

Click to enlarge

*   **Step 5:** Specify the _End Date_ or the date-time on which the triggered campaign should cease getting delivered to the target audience. You can choose _Later_ to stop the campaign at a specific date and time or _Never_ to run the campaign indefinitely (you can always Pause the campaign through _Campaign Overview_.

**Recurring Campaign**

Click to enlarge

*   **Step 1:** Specify the _Delivery Time_ or the frequency and date-time of campaign delivery.
    
*   **Step 2:** Specify the _Start Date_ or the date-time on which the recurring campaign should start getting delivered to the target audience. You can choose to send the campaign _Now_ or _Later_ at the selected date and time.
    

Click to enlarge

*   **Step 3:** Specify the _End Date_ or the date-time when the campaign should cease getting delivered to the target audience. You can choose _Later_ to stop the campaign at a specific date and time or _Never_ to run the campaign indefinitely (you can always Pause the campaign through _Campaign Overview_).

### 

Frequency Capping, DND & Throttling

Click to enlarge

Here you can leverage the features of _Frequency Capping (FC), DND Hours, Queueing, Throttling_ to determine how a user perceives your _WhatsApp campaign_ in the context of your entire brand experience. These features allow you to manage the frequency and timing of campaign delivery for each user.

Let's get you acquainted with the workings of each:

#### 

Frequency Capping

Using _Frequency Capping,_ you can control the number of campaigns a user receives within a _Day, Week, Month_ and maintain a consistent gap between consecutive messages (sent through multiple channels or the same channel).

If you are sending time-sensitive messages, then you can ignore _Frequency Capping_.

Click to enlarge

**Set Frequency Capping Limits**

If you have not set up _Frequency Capping_ yet, then you can choose to configure it by clicking the **Configurations > Frequency Capping** on the left panel. Once set, you will be able to send all your campaigns with FC enabled, including the existing one.

Detailed read on _How to configure FC & Time Gap._

#### 

DND

Using the _DND Settings_ of your account, you can prevent users from receiving campaigns during specific periods, such as when they may be asleep, and so on. The best part - _DND hours_ are determined individually for each user. This means that the duration specified by you will be applied to all your users only in the context of their time zone!

You can skip _DND_ while sending time-sensitive or urgent messages.

Click to enlarge

**Set DND Hours**

If you haven't set up _DND Hours_ yet, then you can choose to configure it by clicking on **Configuration > DND** on the left panel. Once set, you will be able to send all your campaigns with _DND hours_ enabled, including the existing one.

Detailed Read on _How to configure DND Hours_.

#### 

Queueing

If you choose to send a campaign with _Frequency Capping_ or _DND_ enabled, then _Queueing_ is automatically enabled. It's a feature that allows delayed delivery of the message to a user in cases where immediate delivery is not possible due to your _FC_ or _DND settings._

Click to enlarge

*   _Select **Queue message for up to...**, to enable the feature and specify a custom queueing duration for the campaign in Minutes, Hours or Days_.
    *   Doing so will ensure that we hold on to the campaign for the specified duration and send it only when a combination of your _FC_ and _DND settings_ allow us to. _(How delivery time is determined for queued messages)_
*   _Select **Do not Queue messages...** to drop the message if we're unable to deliver it to a user due to FC/DND settings (Disabling Queueing for a campaign)_

#### 

Throttling

Click to enlarge

*   _Select **Do not throttle campaign...** to send all messages instantly to the entire target audience._
    
*   _Select **Throttle campaigns as per channel throttling limits** to control the number of messages delivered per minute._
    
*   _Select **Throttle campaigns at...** to specify a custom message throttling duration for this campaign._
    

> 📘

> Please Note

> This limit cannot be higher than the channel-level throttling limit specified under _Configurations > Throttling._

Message


-----------

Click to enlarge

As highlighted above, the message creation interface comes loaded with intuitive features like _Variations, Dynamic Personalization, and User Preview_ - enabling you to create high-impact messages in minutes.

Let's see how you can create a message in minutes:

### 

Select a Message Template

From the list of whitelisted message templates added to your WebEngage account, select a template that you would like to send to your customers. Templates can be of text, image, video and document types.

### 

Populate Personalization Variables

Personalization variables help you send highly targeted messages.  
Click on the _Icon_ and choose the _User and Event Attributes_ from the drop-down to complete the message template as shown below:

Click to enlarge

#### 

Adding Links to WhatsApp Message

Each time a user clicks on a link included with the message, it's tracked as the performance indicator, _Total Clicks_ and _Unique Clicks_ under the _WhatsApp Campaign's Overview_ section.

In case of WhatsApp, click tracking works in a different manner when compared to other channels as there are multiple types of templates and are required to be pre-approved by WhatsApp . Scenarios where links can/cannot be tracked are added below:

Sr no.

Scenario

Clicks Trackable (Y/N)

Details

1.

Link placed against numbered placeholder {{x}} within the message content.

Y

Whenever you add a link against a numbered placeholder variable {{x}} , we automatically append it to a WebEngage domain (weurl.co) or your configured custom domain while sending the campaign. This allows us to track users who click on it.

2.

Template approved with a static link within the message content.

N

When a static link is added and approved by WhatsApp, the links cannot be appended/shortened as it would lead to template mismatch and campaign failures. So in such cases link clicks cannot be tracked.

3.

Templates with Quick Reply buttons.

N

Quick Reply buttons are like inbound messages on WhatsApp. Since they are not links WebEngage cannot track clicks of these buttons. However you can get the data of such button clicks through your WhatsApp Service Provider.

4.

Button template with a Static link.

N

When a static link is added and approved by WhatsApp, the links cannot be appended/shortened as it would lead to template mismatch and campaign failures. So in such cases link clicks cannot be tracked.

5.

Button template with a dynamic link.

Y

The button clicks in such case can only be tracked when the 'Destination URL' option is selected while creating the campaign (Details mentioned below).

##### 

Buttons with Dynamic link:

While configuring the Message tab, when you select a template with Dynamic button, you will find 2 options for adding the Button Links: 'Dynamic Suffix' and 'Destination URL'.

*   **Dynamic Suffix:** This option has to be selected in cases where you have configured the template with destination domain while approving it through WhatsApp. In this case you only need to configure the suffix thats needs to be appended to the destination domain.

**Note:** When using the option, button clicks will not be tracked.

*   **Destination URL:** If you want to track button clicks through WebEngage, you need to select this option. If selecting this option, you need to make sure to the steps mentioned for approving your template and configuring the campaign:

1.  **While Approving the template at WSP end:** When getting the template with dynamic buttons approved, add the destination domain as _\[https://weurl.co/{{1}}\] OR if you have configured a custom domain then configure the same domain. For example if your custom domain is wsins.com, then, add the destination domain as_ \[https://wsins.co/{{2}}\]
2.  Once the template is approved and added in WebEngage dashboard, select the template while configuring the 'Message' tab of your campaign.
3.  **While creating the campaign on WebEngage:** For dynamic button templates, you will see an option of Destination URL. Add the exact URL where you would like to navigate the users when they click on the button. For example if you want to navigate the user to your website login page then add the exact URL here: \[https://www.westernstateinsurance.com/login\]. You can also add personalized variables here.

By following these steps the clicks of such button will become trackable and will be visible in campaign metrics.

> 🚧
> 
> Please Note
> 
> 
> -----------------
> 
> *   While configuring the Destination URLs, make sure the template is approved with proper URL: \[https://www.weurl.co/{{x}}\]('x' signifies the variable number) OR your custom domain (whichever is applicable.
> *   In case the URL is not configured properly, **it will lead to template mismatch and campaign failures**.
> *   **It is highly recommended**, to test the campaigns before launching to it to make and sure the campaign is configured properly.

#### 

UTM Parameters

*   Start by enabling UTM at the global level through the Configurations section on the dashboard. This ensures that campaign-level UTM tagging is enabled by default. Click here to know how.
*   **Modify or Edit UTM at Campaign Level**: While global UTM is setup, you can modify parameters for specific campaigns as well as per you needs.
*   **Disabling Global UTM**: While disabling the UTM setup at global level you can choose whether to keep UTM for already running campaigns or remove it from all campaigns.

**Note**: Campaigns which are already sent with UTM parameters cannot be removed.

### 

Preview Message

Click to enlarge

As highlighted above, the top panel of the message creation interface allows you to toggle between a **Raw Preview** and **User Preview** to gauge each Variation's message's appearance. Here's how it works:

**Raw Preview**

It displays the raw message and attributes, as added by you.

Click to enlarge

**User Preview**

Allows you to view the message for an actual user from your account by populating it with data from their user profile, as per the elements of personalization added to the template.

Click to enlarge

*   Step 1: Select _User Preview_ from the top panel.
    
*   Step 2: Enter the _User ID,_ preferably of a power user included within the target audience.
    
*   Step 3: Click the _Search and Populate_ button.
    
*   Step 4: Click the _See Preview_ button on the pop-up to visualize the notification with real user data.
    

### 

Create Variations

Variations are just different versions of the campaign's message that facilitate easy multivariate testing and are referred to in the following manner in your dashboard: **Variation A** (the first version of the message), **Variation B** (second version of the message), and so on for subsequent versions.

Click to enlarge

As shown above, by default, the message creation interface consists of a single _Variation A._ You can create up to 5 variations of the message by clicking on the _Plus_ icon.

*   _Select **Create New** to start building the new Variation from scratch_
    
*   _Select **Copy from Variation A** (or any of the previous versions) to make minor edits to the new Variation_
    
*   Each _Variation_ can be created independent of the other, allowing you to test varying messages and links to identify what works best with your target audience.
    
*   The percentage values indicate the share of users that will receive a _Variation_ and can be customized during _Conversion Tracking._

Conversion Tracking


-----------------------

This part of campaign creation allows you to measure the effectiveness of your campaign in various ways like:

*   Tracking conversions for a specific goal.
*   Comparing performance against a control group.
*   Testing multiple variations of the message to identify a winning version.

Hence, it has been divided into two sections:

*   **Conversion Tracking**
*   **Variation Distribution.**

However, depending on the number of message variations created by you, the view of _Conversion Tracking_ will vary:

**When only 1 Variation Exists**

On proceeding to this step from _Message_, you will be welcomed by an interface on which _Conversion Tracking_ is disabled.

**When Multiple Variations Exist**

As shown below, on proceeding to this step from _Message_, you will be welcomed by an interface on which:

*   _Conversion Tracking_ is disabled
*   _Variation Distribution_ meter indicates the share of the audience that will receive each _Variation_

Now, let's get you acquainted with the workings of _Step 4: Conversion Tracking:_

### 

Conversion Tracking (Recommended)

> 🚧
> 
> Must Read
> 
> 
> ---------------
> 
> We recommend that you gain a broad understanding of how _Conversion Tracking_ works in your dashboard before proceeding. Doing so will lay a strong foundation for understanding whether or not you need to enable _Conversion Tracking_ for the campaign and its impact on _Revenue Tracking_.

By default, _Conversion Tracking_ is disabled for all _WhatsApp campaigns._ As shown below, you can use the toggle switch to enable it.

The _Conversion Tracking_ can be set up by:

*   Selecting a Conversion Event
*   Selecting Conversion Deadline
*   Selecting a Control Group (Optional)

##### 

Select a Conversion Event

The term, _Conversion Event_ is an alias that helps identify the event you expect users to perform after receiving the message.

As shown above, you can choose from a list of all the _Custom Events_ being tracked for your account to specify the campaign's conversion goal.

> 👍
> 
> Pro Tip
> 
> 
> -------------
> 
> We recommend that you map all the _Custom Events_ that record the occurrence of a monetary transaction in your app as _Revenue Events_ in your dashboard. This will help ensure that selecting the respective events as the _Conversion Event_ of a campaign helps track _Conversions_ and _Revenue_ for the campaign and its channel.

**Add Attributes to the Conversion Event**

Depending on the end goal of the campaign, you can choose to narrow down the scope of conversion to a specific action. This can be done by adding _attribute filters_ to the selected _Conversion Event._

Here's how you can go about it:

Click to enlarge

**Step 1:** As shown above, click on the filter icon placed next to the drop-down

**Step 2:** As shown below, click _Add Filter_ to add more attributes to the event and apply the _AND/ OR_ logic further.

##### 

Select a Conversion Deadline

The _Conversion Deadline_ is a duration defined by you that tells us when to stop tracking conversions for a campaign.

This means that once your campaign is delivered, we will track users who perform the _Conversion Event_ in the context of its attribute filters (if any), only till the specified _Conversion Deadline._

By default, a _Conversion Deadline of 7 days_ is set for all campaigns. You can choose to specify a custom duration in _Hours or Days,_ as per the campaign's end goal.

##### 

Select a Control Group (Optional)

Click to enlarge

A _Control Group_ is a small portion of the target audience of a campaign that is randomly selected, representing the behavior and preferences of the entire segment, and does not receive the campaign.

An optional but recommended step, adding a _Control Group_ to the target audience allows you to compare the campaign's performance against the organic behavior of _Control Group_ users. This makes for the perfect benchmark to assess the true impact of the campaign on influencing user behavior.

> Detailed read on Control Group.

On checking the Control Group checkbox, you are presented with another choice called 'Target Control Group', that lets you choose between two options.

*   Set a new control group for this campaign
*   Custom Control Group

**Option 1: Set a new control group for this campaign:** This will be a campaign level control group which means a control group that is created for a specific campaign only. The users in this control group are randomly added from the selected segment in 'Audience' tab. This control group is good if the aim is to measure impact for a specific campaign.

On clicking this option, the Variation Distribution slider is exposed that allows you to select percentage of users to be added in Control Group from target audience.

**Option 2: Custom Control Group:** This option is shown when at least one Custom Control Groups is created in your account. Click here for detailed read on creating custom control group.

Since this is a pre-created control group, overlapping users within this group and the target segment won't be receiving the campaigns.

Custom control groups are good for analyzing effectiveness of multiple campaigns. For example: Analyzing effectiveness of SMS and Email campaigns during Diwali sale.

Unlike Campaign level control group, the percentage of users to be part of control group cannot be controlled when Custom control group is selected.

### 

Variation Distribution

Click to enalrge

If you have created multiple variations of the _Message,_ you can choose to automate the testing process by enabling _Send Winning Variation Automatically_. Doing so will allow you to test all the _Variations_ (and _Control Group_ if enabled) with a smaller test audience. We will automatically send the winning variant to the entire target audience.

However, you can opt to test the _Variations_ and _Control Group_ manually if you cannot automate testing due to the small size of the target audience (less than 2,000 users) of a _One-time_ or _Recurring campaign._ Or if you are unwilling to test a _Triggered campaign_ with a minimum of 500 messages.

Depending on the campaign type selected at the steps of setting up automated variation testing will vary as:

*   One-time Campaign
*   Triggered Campaign
*   Recurring Campaign
*   Manual Distribution

**One-time Campaign**

Given the short lifespan of _One-time campaigns_, we suggest that you launch the campaign well in advance for testing and schedule it for delivery at the most viable time slot. Doing so will ensure that your users receive the most effective version of your campaign at a time that records the highest engagement rate.

*   Step 1: Specify Size of Test Audience
    
*   Step 2: Define Time to Test
    
*   Step 3: Select Win Criteria

**Triggered Campaign**

_Triggered campaigns_ are ongoing cycles of communication that are sent to users only when they perform a certain action or _Event_. Thus, the most scientific way to test _Variations_ of a triggered campaign is by ensuring that a significant number of messages are delivered before we draw a comparison.

*   Step 1: Specify Size of Test Audience
*   Step 2: Select Win Criteria

**Recurring Campaign**

If you choose to create a _Recurring campaign_, then the entire first run of the campaign will be considered its _Test Audience_ by default.

*   We will calculate the test results 1 hour before the second run of the campaign to identify a winning variation.
    
*   A winning _Variation_ will be determined as per the _Win Criteria_ and sent as the only campaign to all users from the second run onwards.
    

Thus, as shown below, we just need to define the _Win Criteria_ as _Clicks_ or _Conversions_, and we will take care of the rest.

**Manual Distribution**

If you are unable to set up _Send Winning Variation Automatically_ due to the small size of the target audience (less than 2,000 users) of a _One-time_ or _Recurring campaign,_ or if you are unwilling to test a _Triggered campaign_ with a minimum of 500 messages, then you can choose to test the _Variations_ manually.

#### 

Impact on Variation Slider if Control group is enabled

In case the **Control Groups have been enabled** the Variation Distribution slider behaves differently based on the type of control group selected:

**If Campaign level control group is selected:** In this case, the user will have the option of adding the control group by deciding the percentage or size of the control group on variation distribution slider.

**If Custom Control Group is selected:** You will not be able to manually select the size of the control group using the variation slider since the Custom Control Group is pre-created and overlapping users in the selected Custom Control Group and target segment, won't be receiving the campaign.

> 🚧
> 
> Keep in mind
> 
> 
> ------------------
> 
> *   In a particular campaign, Custom Control Group and campaign control group cannot be applied together.
>     
> *   Universal control group can be added irrespective of Custom Control Group or Campaign Control Group is selected.
>     
> *   In case multiple control groups are applied within same campaign (E.g: Universal Control Group + Custom Control Group or Universal Control Group + Campaign control): In this case, since the users in both the control group are mutually exclusive, the overall control group size will increase and the target audience size will decrease.
