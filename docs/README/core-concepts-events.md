## 📍 Introduction to Events

> 💬 *Preface: Different Users. Different Behaviour. Different Needs.*

Modern marketers face a big challenge: **creating great customer experiences at scale**. But here’s the catch — users are unique. They behave differently, respond differently, and want different things.

So how do we serve millions of users **the right message, at the right time, on the right channel**?

That’s where **personalized lifecycle communication** comes in — driven by behavior.

> 💡 Give users what they want, when they want it, based on what they *do.*

Sounds perfect, right?  
But doing this well requires:

- Tracking user behavior 🔍  
- Understanding their journey 🛤  
- Responding contextually 📬  

That’s exactly what **Events** help you achieve in Jarvis.

## 🧠 Understanding Your User’s Lifecycle {#intro}

To create relevant messaging, you need to understand your user's **lifecycle** — the different stages and experiences they go through while interacting with your product.

Now, we can’t (yet) track someone’s exact mental or emotional state.  
But what we *can* track is their **actions** — their **physical behavior** on your app or website.

Think of actions like:

- 🔎 Searching for a product  
- 🧪 Applying filters  
- 👀 Viewing product details  
- 🛒 Adding to cart  
- 💳 Making a purchase  

> 🧭 A typical digital user’s lifecycle consists of multiple stages, each marked by specific **events** or **actions.**

At every stage, users need a **different message** or motivation. That’s why **one-size-fits-all communication doesn’t work anymore**.

## 🔗 Tying Behavioural Data to Everything You Do {#usage}

To communicate better, you need to **track behavior better**.

Here’s why behavioral data (i.e., Events) is so powerful:

1. 🔍 It helps you analyze user actions and understand what they’re thinking or feeling.  
2. 🧠 It uncovers *why* some users convert quickly, and others don’t.  
3. 🛠 It shows what might be missing from your product, messaging, or journey.

> 👍 **Use Case**  
> Suppose most users drop off between _Evaluation_ and _Conversion_.  
> That’s your cue: **they need motivation** to move forward.

You might:

- 🎁 Offer a discount  
- 💬 Show social proof (testimonials)  
- ⏳ Add urgency with a countdown  
- 🌟 Emphasize the product's value  
- 🧩 Simplify the checkout UX  

While the content and channel may vary, **the insight came from the behavior.**  
And behavior is always recorded as **Events** in Jarvis.

## 🧾 What Are Events in Jarvis?

In Jarvis, **every user action is logged as an Event**.

These Events come with **Attributes** that give you full context, such as:

- 🕒 Time of action  
- 📍 Location  
- 📱 Device used  
- 💰 Price, Quantity  
- 🎯 Campaign Name  

These granular details help you:

- Understand user behavior deeply  
- Segment users meaningfully  
- Trigger precise, real-time campaigns  
- Improve retention and conversions  

> 🧠 **Think of Events as the raw material of intelligence**  
> They help you shape everything from **audiences** to **automations**.
