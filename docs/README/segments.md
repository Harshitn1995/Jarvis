## ✉️ Let's Get You Started with Segmentation

Segmentation helps you group users based on behavior, preferences, or demographics — enabling **personalized marketing** that drives engagement and conversions.

> 🧠 Think of it as creating **mini-audiences** who receive **just the right message** at **just the right time**.

---

## 📌 What is Segmentation?

Segmentation is more than just categorizing users — it’s about understanding **who they are** and **what they need**.

> 👍 **Use Case:**
> You run a grooming product site where 95% of your users are men. Do you send the same message to the remaining 5% women?  
> No — they likely bought as a gift, and their behavior/needs differ.

### Strategy Comparison:

- **Strategy 1:** Group everyone by purchase behavior ✅ Easy but generic  
- **Strategy 2:** Segment by **gender + lifecycle stage** ✅ Contextual and targeted

> 🧠 Mass messaging leads to churn.  
> 🧠 Smart segmentation leads to growth.

> 📘 **Definition:**  
> _Segmentation is the practice of analyzing user behavior, demographics, preferences, and actions to create contextual, personalized engagement that builds lasting relationships._

---

## 🔍 What is Micro-segmentation?

> 📘 _Micro-segmentation breaks down broad groups into **very specific user clusters** — allowing for hyper-personalized communication._

For example:

- 🎯 Male buyers who made a purchase last month  
- 🎁 Female gift-buyers who browsed during festive sales

> 🎯 If you send a _No Shave November_ campaign to everyone, it might confuse or alienate your female segment.

**With Jarvis**, you can easily identify the most reachable channel (Push, SMS, Email, etc.) for each micro-segment.

## 💡 Benefits of Segmenting Your Userbase

### 1️⃣ Understand Motivation to Convert

Use segmentation to decode what drives **repeat purchases** or **causes churn**.

> 👍 **Use Case:**  
> Group 1: Repeat buyers in London  
> Group 2: One-time buyers from a social media campaign

**→ Segment. Analyze. Optimize.**

### 2️⃣ Send Contextually Relevant Messages

Context = Conversions.

> 👍 **Use Case:**  
> Prompt **happy shoppers** (not crash victims) to rate your app.  
> 🎯 Segment by recent session behavior.

You can even:

- 🎟 Offer discount to high-value dormant users  
- 📦 Nudge recent buyers toward a product category they browsed

### 3️⃣ Identify High-ROI Acquisition Sources

> 👍 **Use Case:**  
> Segment your top users and trace their origin (channel, location, campaign).  
> Use this to **double down on winning acquisition strategies**.

### 4️⃣ Drive Retention with RFM Model

Segment users using **Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value**:

| Segment                  | Description                                              | Engagement Strategy                             |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 🏆 VIP Customer           | Frequent, recent, high-spend                             | Loyalty program, exclusive offers               |
| 💸 Big Spender           | High-spend, occasional                                   | Cross-sell & up-sell                            |
| 🔁 Loyal Customer        | Regular, recent but lower spend                          | Referral & feedback campaigns                   |
| ⚠️ High Value Churned    | High-spend, inactive                                     | Reactivation campaigns                          |
| ❄️ Low Value Churned     | Infrequent, low-spend, inactive                          | Light engagement or reactivation nudges         |
| 🆕 New Customer          | Just onboarded                                           | Welcome, product education, early win offers    |

> 🎯 Treating all customers the same = missed opportunity.  
> Segmenting = higher retention, better ROI.

### 5️⃣ Drive Repeat Purchases

Use behavioral segments to cross-sell based on last purchase.

> 👍 **Use Case:**  
> A customer buys a TV → Offer speakers or smart plugs next week.

## 📏 Basic Rules of Segmentation

1️⃣ **🎯 Define Clear Goals**  
Know what you want: Conversions? Retention? Activation?

2️⃣ **🔬 Keep It Small, But Impactful**  
Micro-segments drive precision. One message ≠ fits all.

3️⃣ **⚖️ Stay Practical**  
Avoid over-segmentation. Tiny groups = poor data insights.

4️⃣ **🔍 Ensure Clear Differentiation**  
Each segment should reflect a *unique* user need or behavior.

5️⃣ **🛤 Segment by Lifecycle**  
From new users → power users → churned users  
Map your segments across the **user journey**.
