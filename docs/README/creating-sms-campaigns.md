## ✅ Step-by-Step Guide

### 📝 Step 1: Enter Campaign Details

- **Campaign Name:** Choose a meaningful name for internal reference.
- **Tags:** Optionally add tags to group or track campaigns easily.

---

### 🎯 Step 2: Define Audience

Select from:

- **Live Segment:** Target dynamic user segments based on rules.
- **Static List:** Use a pre-uploaded list of users.
- **All Users:** Broadcast to your entire user base (rarely recommended).

---

### 💬 Step 3: Compose Your SMS

- Keep it under **160 characters** for single message delivery.
- Use **merge tags** to personalize (e.g. `{{name}}`, `{{order_id}}`).
- Avoid using special characters unless necessary (they may increase message cost).

> 💡 **Tip:** Use a clear CTA like _“Tap here to shop now”_ or _“Reply YES to confirm.”_

---

### 🧪 Step 4: Test Your Message

- Send a **test SMS** to your number or team.
- Validate personalization, formatting, and links.

---

### ⏰ Step 5: Schedule or Send Now

- **Send Now:** Instantly dispatch your campaign.
- **Schedule Later:** Choose date/time and timezone.
- **Recurring Campaign:** Set up repeat schedules (e.g. weekly promo).

---

### 🧠 Advanced Settings (Optional)

- Enable **conversion tracking** to measure success.
- Set a **fallback template** in case of delivery failure.
- Limit frequency to avoid spamming users.
