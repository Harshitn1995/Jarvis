## 💡 Why Journeys?

> **Customer centricity. Targeted communication. Contextual experiences. Personalized engagement.**  
>  
> While these terms are commonly used in marketing, they all point to one central idea:  
> _Designing your engagement strategy around each user’s behavior and preferences._

**Journeys** is Jarvis's answer to this:  
A **flexible, logic-based tool** to unify all your communication channels and build consistent, contextual user experiences.

## 🧭 What is a Journey?

> _“A Journey is a wholesome experience that guides each user through various [stages of their lifecycle](user-engagement.html) by engaging them at the right moment, with the most relevant context, via their preferred channel.”_

---

### 🧠 How Journeys Work

When users interact with your app, website, or offline platforms, they move toward certain goals like:

- Placing an order
- Subscribing to a service
- Booking a flight
- Purchasing gadgets
- Investing in a portfolio  
...and more.

But each user is unique — based on preferences, location, device, habits — and experiences your brand differently.  
**Journeys help you build consistent, personalized brand interactions across platforms.**

---

## 🧩 Logic of Journeys

Each Journey is built on:

> **"If-this-happens-then-do-that" logic**

Which allows you to:

- Engage users at the right time
- Space out communications naturally (avoid spam)
- Personalize based on behavior, location, and real-time context

### 🛒 Use Case: Reduce Cart Abandonment (E-commerce)

> **Problem:** Cart abandonment  
> **Goal:** Purchase  
> **Target:** Users who add to cart but don’t buy  
> **Solution:** Offer 10% off + cashback if needed  
> **Channels:** Push Notification, Email  
>  
**Strategy over 2 days:**

1. Observe behavior for 1 day.
2. Send **Push** with 10% offer to non-purchasers.
3. Wait another day → Send **Email** if no purchase.
4. Wait again → Final message with 10% + cashback offer.
5. Stop messaging after that.

> ✅ **Result:** 3x uplift in conversions!
