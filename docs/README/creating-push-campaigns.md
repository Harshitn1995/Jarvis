Engaging users with _Push Notifications_ is an effective way to convey time-sensitive messages, grab their attention with offers, and drive app engagement. Your dashboard comes with a highly intuitive 6-step campaign creation interface that makes it easy to create and execute highly personalized campaigns in minutes!

> At WebEngage, we are obsessed with enabling consumer business, like yours, to create contextual experiences that facilitate retention-led growth. This is why user data _(User Attributes)_, behavioral data _(Events & Event Attributes)_ and _Segments_ play an integral role in campaign creation. We recommend that you get yourself acquainted with the respective concepts before proceeding.

**Here's a quick summary of the exciting possibilities offered by the campaign creation interface:**

*   **Personalize messages** to each user's preferences and behavior, across the various stages of their lifecycle _(skip to Step 3: Message)_
    
*   **Deep link _Push Notification_ images** to specific screens in your app _(skip to Step 3: Message)_
    
*   **Target multiple apps** with a Push campaign! _(skip to Step 1: Audience)_
    
*   **Automate multivariate message testing** for your campaign - we'll automatically identify a winner and send it to the entire audience _(skip to Step 4: Conversion Tracking & Variation Distribution)_
    
*   Leverage ready-to-use templates to **engage users with rich Push Notifications** _(skip to Step 3: Message, Layout)_
    
*   **Test your campaign with internal team members** before sending it to your users _(skip to Step 5: Test Campaign)_
    
*   **Avoid disturbing users during DND hours,** implemented in their timezone _(skip to Step 2: When DND)_
    
*   **Schedule campaigns for delayed delivery** to users who are currently unavailable _(skip to Step 2: When, Queueing)_

> Please ensure that you have integrated _FCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging)_ and _APNS (Apple Push Notification Services)_ with your account before proceeding as these platforms enable campaign delivery to all your _Android_ and _iOS_ users, respectively. Here's the integration guide.

Select Campaign Type


------------------------

As shown below, the campaign creation interface can be accessed by clicking the _Plus icon_ placed on the top left of the _central hub of Push_. In doing so, you will be prompted to select the type of campaign you'd like to create:

Click to enlarge

Let's walk you through each campaign type:

#### 

One-time

These are stand-alone messages that are sent to your users only once and generally comprise of time-bound offers, festive deals, product updates and so on. Such campaigns end as soon as they're delivered to the target audience.

*   _When:_ Launch immediately or Schedule for later
*   _How Often:_ Once only

> 🚧
> --
> 
> **Skip to Step 2, When:** Campaign Schedule > Setting up One-time Campaign

#### 

Triggered

These are ongoing cycles of communication that are sent to only those users of your target audience, who perform a particular event on your app/website.

*   _When:_ Launch immediately or Schedule for later
*   _How Often:_ Whenever the specified _Event_ is performed by a user or a few _Minutes/ Hours/ Days_ after the event occurs

> 🚧
> --
> 
> **Skip to Step 2, When:** Campaign Schedule > Setting up Triggered Campaign

#### 

Recurring

These are ongoing cycles of communication that are scheduled to be sent periodically to its target audience. Such campaigns help you automate communication for several recurring events in your user's lifecycle like _subscription renewals, policy renewals, bill payments, recurring investments_ and so on.

Or you could leverage these campaigns to _engage all new users who have recently signed up, users who performed a certain action on your app but left without transacting or proceeding to the next stage_ and so on.

*   _When:_ Launch immediately or Schedule for later
*   _How Often:_ Daily, Weekly or Monthly

> 🚧
> --
> 
> **Skip to Step 2, When:** Campaign Schedule > Setting up Recurring Campaign

#### 

Transactional

These are highly contextual messages that your users expect to receive while interacting with your brand through your app, website or offline. This could be acknowledging user interactions like, _sign up (welcome newsletter), password reset, payment confirmation (invoice), order confirmation or conveying payment reminders, account statements_ and so on.

*   _When:_ Launch immediately
*   _How Often:_ Whenever a specific _Event_ occurs in your backend

Now, let's walk you through all the steps of campaign creation.

Step 1: Define the Audience


-------------------------------

### 

Name your Campaign

The first step is to give your campaign a unique name that helps you identify its purpose.

Click to enlarge

### 

Select Target Devices

As shown above, you can choose to create campaigns exclusively for your _Android_ or _iOS_ users by specifying a _Target Device._ The following options can be selected here:

*   Both Android & iOS
*   Android only
*   iOS only

Click to enlarge

### 

Select Target Apps

> 📘
> 
> Please Note
> 
> 
> -----------------
> 
> This option will show only if you have integrated multiple Android/ iOS apps while configuring Push & target a few of these through the campaign selectively.

#### 

3A. Specify Target Android Apps

If you have added multiple app credentials while configuring _Push for Android,_ then by default, all the apps will be targeted. You can alter this by removing _Android Package Names_ to target specific apps with the message.

*   Send to all apps send the _Push Notifications_ to all the configured apps.
*   Send to specific apps will send the notification to the particular apps of your choice. You can select which apps the notification will be sent to by clicking on the _Pencil_ icon. A new modal will open with the list of apps, letting you choose them by selecting or deselecting them. You can also search the _Package Name_ through the search bar. Click _Save_ to save the changes as shown below.

Click to enlarge

This field is hidden if you have selected iOS only under _Target Devices._

> 📘
> 
> Please Note
> 
> 
> -----------------
> 
> You can choose up to 100 apps at a time.

#### 

3B. Specify Target iOS Apps

If you have added multiple app credentials while configuring _Push for iOS,_ then by default all the apps will be selected here as target apps. You can choose to remove the respective _iOS Bundle Identifiers_ to target select apps with the message.

*   Send to all apps send the _Push Notifications_ to all the configured apps.
*   Send to specific apps will send the notification to the particular apps of your choice. You can select which apps the notification will be sent to by clicking on the _Pencil_ icon. A new modal will open with the list of apps, letting you choose the apps by selecting or deselecting them. You can also search the _Package Name_ through the search bar. Click _Save_ to save the changes as shown below.

Click to enlarge

This field is hidden if you have selected _Android only_ under _Target Devices._

> 📘
> 
> Please Note
> 
> 
> -----------------
> 
> You can choose up to 100 apps at a time.

### 

Check Enhanced Delivery Options

> 📘
> 
> Please Note
> 
> 
> -----------------
> 
> This option will show only if you have configured Mi or Huawei Push messaging services while setting up Push channel integration. Learn more.

Based on push channel configurations added (Mi, Huawei or both), corresponding options will be shown and will by default be selected. For e.g. if you have added Mi push services creds, then in Enhanced Delivery Options only Mi push services will be shown.

### 

Select Audience Type

One of the key differentiators of successful campaigns is that they're tailored to the behavior and preferences of a specific group of users. Thus, by selecting an _Audience Type,_ you can choose to target a specific segment of users or combine several segments to define your _Push campaign's_ audience.

As shown below:

Click to enlarge

*   Select **Send to users in single segment** to target all users who are included within a particular segment _(How to set it up)_
    
*   Select **Send to users in multiple segments and/or don't send to users in certain segments** to narrow down the audience to a very specific user persona, defined by including and excluding several segments from the target audience _(How to set up the conditions - Send To & Don't Send To)_
    

Here's how you can set up each _Audience Type_:

### 

Select Target Segment(s)

Here's how you can set up each _Audience Type_:

#### 

5A. Select a Segment (Send To)

_(If **Send to users in single segment** is selected as Audience Type)_

As shown below, click the dropdown nested beside _Send To,_ to specify the target segment.

Click to enlarge

Let's quickly walk you through **Segment Preview**:

**Reachable Users:** Indicates the number of users, from the selected segment, that can be engaged through _Push_ as a channel, at present.

*   For example, your target segment could include 10,000 users, but only 7,000 of those users could be reachable through _Push_ at present. This could happen if:
    *   A user has disabled _Push_ on their registered device.
    *   A user has uninstalled your app.
    *   A user is not reachable on the _Android/iOS devices_ selected under _Target Device_.
    *   A user is not reachable on the _Android/iOS apps_ selected by you under _Target Android Apps_ and _Target iOS Apps,_ respectively.

**Rules of Segmentation:** You can choose to segment your entire user base by 3 broad parameters - _User (attributes), Behavior and Technology._ Thus, _Segment Preview_ presents a snapshot of the parameters based on which users have been grouped together.

#### 

5B. Combine Segments (Send To)

_(If **Send to users in multiple segments and/or don't send to users in certain segments** is selected as Audience Type)_

Using multiple segments to define the target audience is an excellent way to target users that have similar preferences, belong to the same location or have performed certain actions on your app/website - without creating a new segment.

Here's how you can go about it:

Click to enlarge

**Step 1: Select a Condition**

*   _Select **Users in ANY of these segments** to send the campaign to all the users included within each segment._
    
*   \*Select **Users in ALL of these segments** to send the campaign only those users who are shared by all the segments.
    

**Step 2: Select a Segment**

**Step 3: Click Add Segment** to select another one

For example, in the visual above, we have selected the condition, _Users in ALL of these segments_ to combine 2 segments - _Inactive Users_ and _Cart Abandon(ers)._

*   On selecting the second segment, the _Reachable Users_ decrease to 604 from 3,456.
*   This indicates that the campaign will be sent to only 604 users who are common amongst both the selected segments.

#### 

5C. Exclude User Frome These Segments (Don't Send To)

_(If **Send to users in multiple segments and/or don't send to users in certain segments** is selected as Audience Type)_

You can choose to exclude a segment or multiple segments from the target audience by configuring the field, _Exclude User Frome These Segments._ This is a great way to selectively engage users that match a specific persona. Here's how you can add the exclusion criteria:

Click to enlarge

**Step 1: Select a Condition**

*   _Select **Users in ANY of these segments** to prevent users in each segment from receiving the campaign._
    
*   _Select **Users in ALL of these segments** to prevent only those users from receiving the campaign that are common between all the segments._
    

**Step 2: Select a Segment**

**Step 3: Click Add Segment** to select another one.

> 🚧
> 
> When Segment Isn't Specified Under the field, 'Send To'
> 
> 
> -------------------------------------------------------------
> 
> By default, a campaign is set to be delivered to _All Users._ Thus, if no segment is selected under _Send To_ AND segments are specified under _Don't Send To,_ then _the campaign will be send to all the users who are reachable on Push AND are not included within the specified segments._

#### 

Edit Segment

Click on the _Edit icon,_ placed next to the dropdown, _Send To,_ to edit the selected _Segment._ In doing so, you will be prompted by a pre-populated pop-up with the existing segmentation rules.

Click to enlarge

Make your edits and click _Save_ to proceed. In doing so, you will preview the number of reachable users as per your edits.

#### 

Create a New Segment

You can choose to create a new _Segment \_of users from the campaign creation interface by clicking on the \_Create Segment button._ In doing so, you will be prompted by a pop-up, allowing you to build a new segment.

Click to enlarge

Once created, you will be able to access the _Segment_ through the _List of Segments_ in your dashboard.

#### 

Creating a New, Single-use Segment

You can also choose to create disposable segments or segment users specifically for the campaign and avoid adding it to the _List of Segments_ in your dashboard.

Click to enlarge

As shown above, this can be achieved by leaving the field _Name Your Segment_ blank while creating the segment. In doing so, it will become an _Ad hoc segment_ in your dashboard, which will be available only for sending the campaign you're currently creating.

Click to enlarge

*   **When the box is checked**, the campaign will not be sent to users who are part of the Universal Control Group in the segment that is selected.
*   **When the box is unchecked**, the campaign will be sent to all users that are part of the segment inclusive of the Universal Control Group users.

Step 2: Specify When to Send


--------------------------------

As highlighted above, the second step of campaign creation allows you to specify when and how often you'd like the _target audience_ to receive the _Push Notification_ and manage the role your campaign plays in your overall engagement strategy. Hence, _When_ has been divided into two sections:

*   Campaign Schedule
*   Frequency Capping & DND

Let's get you acquainted with the workings of each:

### 

Campaign Schedule

Here you can specify **when and how often** the target audience should receive the campaign. This can be determined by configuring the Campaign Type selected when you initiated creation. Here's how you can go about it:

> 🚧
> 
> Navigate to:
> 
> 
> ------------------
> 
> One-time Campaign
> 
> Triggered Campaign
> 
> Recurring Campaign

#### 

Setting up One-time Campaign

**Step 1:** As shown below, select _One-time_ as the _Campaign Type_

Click to enlarge

**Step 2:** Specify the _Delivery Time_

As shown above:

*   _Select **Now** to send the campaign immediately_
*   _Select **Later** to schedule the campaign:_ You can choose from the 2 options i.e. _Send Intelligently_ or to send at a specific time.
    *   **Send Intelligently**: optimizes campaign send-time for each user, our system intelligently decides the best time to send a campaign based on your user’s interactions with past campaigns of each channel. Click here to know more.
    *   **Send at Specific Time**: You can specify the time at which you would like to send your campaign to your users, either from the _users time zone_ or the campaign's _project time zone_.  
        You can choose to schedule a _one-time Push campaign_ for delivery in your user's timezone! _(How it works)_

#### 

Setting up Triggered Campaign

Click to enalrge

**Step 1:** Select _Triggered_ as the _Campaign Type_

**Step 2:** Select _the Event upon the occurrence of which the campaign will be triggered or sent to the user_

> 📘
> 
> The following options can be selected here:
> 
> 
> -------------------------------------------------
> 
> *   **Custom** _(all the custom events being tracked for your account)_
>     
> *   **System** _(all the campaign events pre-defined by us for tracking user-channel interactions like app installed, push delivered, push opened and so on.)_
>     

**Step 3 (Optional):** _Add Attribute Filters to the Event_ by clicking on the filter icon

> 📘
> 
> The following options can be selected here:
> 
> 
> -------------------------------------------------
> 
> *   **Custom** (all the custom attributes attached to the custom event selected as the trigger event)
>     
> *   **Time** _(Event Time)_
>     
> *   **Location** _(City, Country)_
>     
> *   **Technology** (Device Manufacturer, Device Model, Carrier, App Version, App ID, SDK Version)
>     
> *   **Engagement** _(Campaign ID, Journey ID - can be found under the campaign's overview & journey's overview)_
>     
>     *   These attributes are applicable only to _campaign events_ like _Email Rejected, Push, Dismissed_ and so on.
> *   **Others** _(Session Count, Language)_
>     

*   Further, you can choose to club multiple event attributes by the _AND/OR logic_ to define the scope of occurrence of the event.
    
*   Doing so implies that if users included within the target segment don't perform the specified _Event,_ in the context of the added attribute filter(s), then they will not receive the campaign.
    

> 🚧
> 
> How It Works: Clubbing Event Attributes by AND/OR Logic
> 
> 
> -------------------------------------------------------------
> 
> **AND:** _Implies that users will have to perform the Event in the context of all the event attributes to receive the campaign._ (Helps you narrow down the target audiece)
> 
> **OR:** _Implies that users will receive the campaign if they perform the Event in the context of any one of the_ event attribute.\* (Helps you widen the target audience)

**Step 4:** Specify the _Delivery Time_ of the triggered campaign

*   _Select **Send as soon as the event occurs** to deliver the campaign immediately_
*   _Select **Wait for (duration) and then send** to deliver the campaign after sometime_
*   You can set up a wait time in _Minutes, Hours or Weeks_, after which the campaign will be sent to the respective users

**Step 5:** Specify the _Start Date_ or the date-time on which the triggered campaign should start getting delivered to the target audience

*   _Select **Now** to send the campaign immediately_
*   _Select **Later** to schedule the campaign_

**Step 6:** Specify the _End Date_ or the date-time on which the triggered campaign should cease getting delivered to the target audience

*   _Select **Never** to run the campaign indefinitely_ (you can always choose to _Pause_ a campaign manually through its _Campaign Overview_)
*   _Select **Later** to stop the campaign at a specific date-time in the near future_

> 🚧
> --
> 
> **Skip to** the second section, _Frequency Capping & DND_ to complete _Step 2: When_, of the campaign creation process.

#### 

Setting up Recurring Campaign

**Step 1:** As shown below, select _Recurring_ as the _Campaign Type_

Click to enlarge

**Step 2:** Specify the _Start Date_ or the date-time on which the recurring campaign should start getting delivered to the target audience.

*   _Select **Now** to send the campaign immediately_
*   _Select **Later** to schedule the campaign_

**Step 3:** Specify the _Delivery Time_ or the frequency and date-time of campaign delivery.

The frequency of a recurring campaign can be set as:

*   _Daily,_ at a specific _Time_
*   _Weekly,_ at a specific _Day and Time_
*   _Monthly,_ on a specific _Day of the Month and Time_

**View Realised Schedule** shows you the entire schedule for your campaign as set by you.

**Step 4:** Specify the _End Date_ or the date-time on which the campaign should cease getting delivered to the target audience.

*   _Select **Never** to run the campaign indefinitely_ (you can always choose to _Pause_ a campaign manually through its _Campaign Overview)_
*   _Select **Later** to stop the campaign at a specific date-time in the near future_

### 

Frequency Capping & DND

Click to enlarge

Here you can leverage the features of _Frequency Capping (FC), DND Hours, Queueing_ and _Throttling_ to determine how a user perceives your _Push campaign_ in the context of your entire engagement experience.

**Context:** Campaigns don't exist in isolation. Most marketing campaigns are designed for a specific audience, motivating them to perform a particular action. And more often than not, users receive multiple campaigns through various channels, nudging them towards a similar goal.

**Thus, these features allow you to manage the frequency and timing of campaign delivery for each user.** Let's get you acquainted with the workings of each:

#### 

Frequency Capping (FC)

Using _Frequency Capping (FC),_ you can control the number of campaigns a user receives within a _Day, Week, Month_ and maintain a consistent gap between consecutive messages (sent through multiple channels or the same channel).

Click to enlarge

As highlighted above:

*   _Select **Follow...** to send the campaign as per your account's frequency capping and time gap settings_
    
    *   This means that if the upper limit on the number of messages a user can receive within a day, week, or month is exhausted, then this campaign will get queued for delayed delivery _(detailed read on how this works)_
*   _Select **Ignore...** to ensure campaign delivery even if the frequency cap for the day/week/month has been met for a user (impact of disabling FC for a campaign)_
    

**Set Frequency Capping Limits**

#### 

DND

Using your account's _DND Settings_, you can prevent users from receiving campaigns during specific periods such as when they may be asleep so on. The best part - _DND hours_ are determined individually for each user. This means that _the duration specified by you will be applied to all your users only in the context of their time zone!_

As highlighted above:

*   _Select **Follow...** to ensure that users aren't disturbed by the Push Notifications at the hours specified by you (as per their timezone)_
*   _Select **Ignore...** to ensure campaign delivery even if \_DND hours_ are applicable to a few users (Disabling DND for a campaign)\_

**Set DND Hours**

If you haven't set up _DND Hours_ yet, then you can choose to configure it by clicking the _Configuration > DND_ in a new tab. Once set, you will be able to send all your campaigns with _DND hours_ enabled, including the existing one.

#### 

Queueing

If you choose to send a campaign with _FC_ or _DND_ enabled, then _Queueing_ is automatically enabled. It's a feature that allows delayed delivery of the message to a user, in cases where immediate delivery is not possible due to your _FC_ or _DND settings._

Click to enlarge

As highlighted above:

*   _Select **Queue message for up to...**, to enable the feature and specify a custom queueing duration for the campaign in Minutes, Hours or Days_.
    
    *   Doing so will ensure that we hold on to the campaign for the specified duration and send it only when a combination of your _FC_ and _DND settings_ allow us to. _(How delivery time is determined for queued messages)_
    *   **Impact on campaign delivery to Android app users:** if _FCM_ is unable to deliver the campaign immediately to a user due to a technical error or if they’re out of network coverage area, then their systems too will continue to attempt message delivery until the specified queueing duration or `time_to_live` _(detailed read on TTL in FCM)_
*   _Select **Do not Queue messages...** to drop the message if we're unable to deliver it to a user due to FC/DND settings (Disabling Queueing for a campaign)_
    
    *   **Impact on campaign delivery to Android app users:** If a campaign is sent with _Queueing disabled,_ and _FCM_ is unable to deliver the message to a user, then the message will be dropped immediately _(detailed read)_

#### 

Throttling

>     

### 

Configure Overlay Layout

Create push notifications with the full Image with Text Overlay. In this layout the background image covers the entire space available for the push notification. While, the text can also be added which will appear on top of the image.

> 🚧
> 
> Note
> 
> 
> ----------
> 
> This feature requires access permission. To enable it, please contact your Customer Success Manager (CSM) or email us at:\[email protected\]

#### 

Step 1: Select an Image

As shown above, an overlay image can be added in two ways:

*   **Insert Image Link**: The image must be hosted on a publicly accessible domain to ensure that it renders for all users receiving the message.
*   **Upload Image**: Click the Upload button placed next to the field, image and select a file from your desktop. In doing so, the image will get hosted on WebEngage's domain: https://afiles.webengage.com.  
    You can always click the Reset button to link/upload a new image.  
    Recommended image size: Dimensions to be 262:184px; in JPG, JPEG, PNG, Gif formats only and less than 1 MB in size.

#### 

Step 2: Collapsed Image (Android)

This is how your notification will look in the collapsed state, this capability is only available for Android, whereas iOS doesn’t let us do that. There are 2 options that are available here with the capability to customize the collapsed state of a push notification.

*   **Default App Icon**: This option is selected by default, meaning there won’t be a background image in the collapsed state of your notification and a large app icon will be displayed on the right side of the notification.
*   **Custom Image**: On choosing this option, you now have the choice of uploading another image for the collapsed state of your notification or copy the same image as you uploaded in the image field above by checking on the ‘Copy image as above’ box.

#### 

Step 3: Collapsed Image Width

You can also select the width of the background image in the collapsed state between the 2 choices: Full and Half.

*   **Full**: This image takes up the whole width of the collapsed state of your notification.
*   **Half**: The image would be placed on the right half of the notification area, whereas for RTL languages this would be mirrored and the image would be placed on the left half of the notification area.

#### 

Step 4: Text and Action

Set up the title, description and on-click action that you would like to compliment with the image.

> 📘
> 
> Use Case: Full Image with No Text
> 
> 
> ---------------------------------------
> 
> When focusing exclusively on your Android audience only, the main 'Text and Action' section would be optional, enabling you to send a full image with no text overlay, which is used for image prominence. However, if you opt for 'Both Android and iOS’, and ‘iOS only’ this section is mandatory.

#### 

Text and Action (Lower Android SDK Versions)

Overlay push notifications are currently supported only on the _latest Android Core SDK v4.8.0, iOS Core SDK v6.6.1 and Extension SDK v1.1.1 and above_. Therefore for all other lower versions of Android devices that don’t support this feature, we offer an option to add alternate text, i.e. lower SDK users will receive a text layout push notification with the title and description you provide in this section.

Below each subsection, i.e. title and description, there are checkboxes labeled ‘Copy Title and above’ and ‘Copy Description as above’ respectively, this enables you to copy the content from the previous ‘Text and Action’ section.

> 🚧
> 
> Keep In Mind
> 
> 
> ------------------
> 
> In case your customers are on a lower version for Android SDK, then the notification sent is a ‘Text’ Layout i.e. Title and Description provided in ‘Text and Action (Lower Android SDK Versions)’ section. Whereas, for customers on lower iOS SDK versions the notification is sent in the ‘Text’ layout, i.e. Title and Description provided in ‘Text and Action’.

#### 

Step 5: Advanced Options (Android)

By sliding this section on, you can add a few more advanced features to the notification of your users. Here are some of the advanced features you can add.

*   **Message Summary**: Add a short summary of the message you are sending.
*   **Sticky Push**: By checking this box, you have enabled the option to add buttons to your notification, your users will not be able to swipe and dismiss the notification. They will have to take action to dismiss the notification. Checking this option automatically enables the Buttons switch as well.
*   **Buttons**: You can add upto 3 buttons, which will be displayed at the bottom of the notification.

#### 

Advanced Option (iOS)

By enabling this option you will be introduced to similar options as the advanced options in android, but instead of a ‘Message Summary’ you have ‘Subtitle’, and ‘Buttons'.

*   **Subtitle**: as the name suggests, this allows you to add a subtitle to your push notification.
*   **Buttons**: By toggling this option on, you can choose from different variations of buttons. Click here to know more.

### 

Configure Carousel Layout

> 🚧
> --
> 
> Text and Image guidelines for creating Carousle Push Notifications

The _Carousel Images_ section, enables you to:

*   Personalize the images to each user or add a generic image to the carousel
*   Personalize the on-click action deep links to each user for all the mage to a screen in your app

Here's how you can go about it:

#### 

Step 1: Select the Carousel Layout

Click to enlarge

As shown above, you can choose between a _Landscape_ or _Portrait_ style template for your notification, depending on the dimensions of the images being used.

*   Click the _Add Image button_ to add a maximum of 5 images to the carousel.
*   Click the _Reset_ button to start from scratch anytime you like!

#### 

Step 2: Auto-Scroll (Optional)

If you like the images within the carousel to scroll automatically, then select this option. You will need to specify the the time after which each image should scroll.

**Note:** Once a user manually scrolls the image, the auto-scrolling will stop.

#### 

Step 3: Add Carousel Images

Click to enlarge

As shown above, a generic carousel image can be added in any of the following ways:

**1\. Insert Image Link:** The image must be hosted on a crawlable/publicly accessible domain to ensure that it renders for all users receiving the message.

**2\. Upload Image:** Click the _Upload_ button placed next to the field, image and select a file from your desktop. In doing so, the image will get hosted on WebEngage's domain: _https://afiles.webengage.com_.

You can always click the _Reset_ button to link/upload a new image.

Note: Gif are not supported in Carousel, due to auto scroll and multiple GIFs it may surpass limit of the Bitmap, Size of the notification will increase drastically

>     

#### 

Step 3: Add Label (CTA)

_(Mandatory)_

_Label_ refers to the text added below the image and doubles up as a _Call-to-Action (CTA)_ for each fold of the _Carousel._

#### 

Step 4: Insert Deep Link (On-click Action)

You can choose to deep-link each image to a specific screen in your _Android_ and _iOS app,_ or direct users to a web page by specifying an _On-click Action,_ as shown below.

Further, you will notice that the deep links specified for the _Android app_ are in a different format compared to the links specified for the _iOS app._ This is because we have created a unique _URI_ for each collection in our _Android app_ while we are leveraging _Universal Links_ for the iOS app (the same link is also used for our website).

### 

Configure Timer Layout

#### 

Step 1: Select a Template

We offer three distinct options for the timer template:

*   **Countdown:** A simple countdown timer will be shown on the right side of your push notification.
*   **Countdown with Progress bar:** A progress bar indicating how much time is remaining to start or end a campaign, along with the countdown timer will be present in your notification.
*   **Big Countdown:** As the name suggests, the notification will have bigger countdown, thus giving more focus to the countdown.

#### 

Step 2: Set Timer

After selecting the template, you need to set the timer value. This can be done in 2 ways:

*   **By Duration:** This option allows you to set the duration for how long you would like the timer to run for **(once the user receives the notification)**.

For example, if you’ve set the timer value (duration) for 4 hours and 30 mins, all your customers will receive a timer notification of the same duration, irrespective of the actual time of them receiving the notification. So, if one of your customers receives this notification at 11 am while the other receives at 4 pm (due to the unavailability of a cellular network) , the countdown for both of them will begin from 4 hours and 30 mins.

*   **By End Time:** This timer automatically counts the difference between the current time of the user versus the time at which you’ve set the timer value irrespective of time. Here the value is taken in Date and Time and it needs to set as per when you would like to end the campaign. Note must be taken that you can only set the timer value 2 days from the time you have scheduled the campaign on the ‘When’ page.

Example: Suppose you have an upcoming sale on 7th December and you want to notify all your users about it on 6th December. You then set the date value as 7th December and timer value as 00:00 and launch the campaign on 6th December 6 pm. If two customers are receiving the notification and one receives it right away at 6pm, and the other receives the notification at 11 pm, then first customer will receive the notification with a countdown value starting from approximately 6 hours, whereas the second customer will receive with countdown value starting from approximately 1 hours. Therefore by using this option, the time duration will vary according to when the customer receives the notification, and is based on the difference in time from receiving the notification and the end time set for the countdown.

**Timer Color and Progress Bar color**

You can also choose the color of your timer and progress bar (for template with progress bar), by checking the box.

#### 

Step 3: Text and Action (for Android)

Set up the title, description and on-click action that you would like to compliment with the timer.

#### 

Step 4: Text & Action (iOS and lower Android SDK versions)

Since timer push notifications are currently **only available for Android devices, with apps using after WebEngage SDK version 4.7.0**, therefore for all other lower versions and iOS devices that don’t support this feature, we offer an option to add alternate text. These devices will receive the notification without the text set here and without the countdown.

#### 

Step 5: Add an Image (optional)

You can slide to switch on this option which then enables you to either add a link to the image or upload an image from your device that will be shown along with your notification to the users.

**Note:** GIF is not supported on

Timer layout is re-rendered every second

### 

Configure Ratings Layout

> 🚧
> --
> 
> Image and text guidelines for Rating Notifications

Click to enlarge

The _Rating_ section lets you configure the background image and message for your Rating style Push Notification. Here's how you can go about it:

#### 

Step 1: Add Title & Description

As shown below, you can create a dynamic _Title_ and _Description_ for the _Push Notification_ by adding relevant _User Attributes_ and _Custom Events_ to the message through the _Personalization icon_ nested under each field.

For example, you can personalize the _Rating template_ to the user's first name and the last product purchased by them by adding the following tokens as placeholders in our message:

*   `{{user['system']['first_name']}}` - For adding the user's first name
*   `{{event['custom']['Order Placed']['custom']['Products']}}` - For adding the name of the product purchased by the user

Thus, whenever the _Push Notification_ is sent, we will populate the tokens with the corresponding values gleaned for the respective users, helping you communicate one-on-one at scale.

#### 

Step 2: Customize Text & Background Color

You can easily add your brand colors to the palette and customize the look and feel of the _Push Notification_ as per your needs. However, if you are adding a background image, then it will override the background color settings.

#### 

Step 3: Add Background Image

You can add a generic background image can be added in any of the following ways:

**1\. Insert Image Link:** The image must be hosted on a crawlable/publicly accessible domain to ensure that it renders for all users receiving the message.

**2\. Upload Image:** Click the _Upload_ button next to the field image and select a file from your desktop. In doing so, the image will get hosted on WebEngage's domain: _https://afiles.webengage.com_.

You can always click the _Reset_ button to link/upload a new image.

### 

Text & Action

Add the _Title_ and _Description_ for the \*Push Notification. You can customize the notification with the rich text editor support which will allow you to style (bold, italics, etc.) the text and apply font colors.

#### 

Adding _On-click Action_ Link

In addition to the _On-click Action_ specified for the _Carousel images,_ you can specify a global _On-click Action_ for all your _Android_ users, as shown in the visual above. This link will be applied to those areas of the _Push Notification_ that are currently unlinked, as highlighted below.

### 

Advanced Options (Android)

Using the options nested under this field, you can customize the experience for your _Android_ users by linking the entire _Push Notification_ to a particular app screen and adding _CTAs/Buttons_ to it, as shown below. Simply click the _Toggle button_ to enable _Advanced Options_ and get started!

_This field_ gets hidden if you have specified _iOS only_ as the _Target Device at Step 1: Audience._ Now, let's walk you through its features:

#### 

Message Summary

This field will allow you to add content besides the App name for Android _Push Notification_.

#### 

Sticky Push

Android allows you to set a _Push Notification_ as sticky i.e. the user will not be able to swipe and dismiss the push notification and will have to take an action (click the action text) for the notification to be dismissed. It is necessary to add at least **one action button** in sticky push notifications. _Sticky Push Notifications_ are supported in _Text and Banner layouts_

#### 

Large Icon

Large icon option allows you customize the icon shown on the right of the notification. By default, if no image is added then the app icon is shown here. This option is supported for Text, Banner, Carousel and Rating layouts.

#### 

Auto-Dismiss Notification

By enabling this option, the notification will be automatically dismissed after the time set. This option is available for all layouts except Timer.

#### 

Adding Action Buttons

Available only for _Banner_ and _Text_ layouts, as shown in the image, click the toggle button to enable and add up to 3 buttons to your _Push Notification_ for _Android_ users.

Following are different action button types supported from SDK v4.9.0 onwards:

Sr. No

Action button type

Description

1.

URL/Deeplinks

(Selected by default) Redirects users to a particular screen or page within or outside you app.

2.

Copy

Allows users to copy the intended text (E.g OTPs, promo codes, etc.).

3.

Share

Capability to Share a specific text, link, etc. like inviting friends to join your app to avail themselves of additional offers.

4.

Call

Allows users to copy the phone number you’re providing to their native phone dial.

5.

Snooze

Clicking on this button type temporarily hides notifications by clicking the "Snooze" button. Once clicked, the notification will disappear from view and reappear after a time interval specified by you, allowing the customers to manage their notification interruptions more effectively.

6.

Track Events

Gives the capability to collect responses and track events through notification clicks and update their value (without opening the app).

7.

Set User Attribute

Gives the capability to track or update user attributes (without opening the app).

8.

Dynamic/Custom Action

Apart from the above mentioned action types, if there are any other actions that you intent to run then this option can be used. It allows you to create custom actions that allow specific to your app/ use case. This would involve assistance from your tech team.

You can personalize the button link to each user's behavioral history, preferences or details.

#### 

Dismiss Button

The dismiss button is supported from Android SDK versions 4.7.0 and higher. Unlike other CTA buttons, Adding Dismiss button to a push notification allows the user to dismiss the push without being redirected to the app. If a user clicks on this button, then the 'Dismiss' event will be tracked rather than the 'Click'.

> 📘
> 
> Note
> 
> 
> ----------
> 
> For each campaign variation, only one Dismiss button can be added.

**Why can't buttons be added to a _Carousel_ or _Rating_ template?**

Given the highly interacted nature of these types of _Push Notifications,_ we have made it possible for you to customize the buttons, images, and links individually for each layout. Hence, adding buttons separately for Android users will defeat the purpose of customization made while _Configuring the Carousel Layout_ or the _Rating Layout._

### 

Advanced Options (iOS)

Using the options nested under this field, you can customize the experience for your _iOS_ users by linking the entire _Push Notification_ to a particular app screen and adding _CTAs/Buttons_ to it, as shown below. Simply click the _Toggle button_ to enable _Advanced Options_ and get started!

Click to enlarge

This field gets hidden if you have select _Android only_ as the_Target Device at Step 1: Audience._ Now, let's walk you through its features:

#### 

Subtitle

This field will allow you to add more content below the title field for _Push Notification_. This feature is supported for _Text, Banner, and Carousel_ layout.

#### 

Sound

By default, all push have the same notification sound as per the phone settings. This option allows you set a custom sound for a particular notification. You need to mention the sound file in .aiff, .wav, or .caf format.

**Note:**The mentioned sound file needs to be present in app files. If not present then the default notification sound will be played. Please contact your tech team for further assistance.

#### 

Adding Buttons

As you must be aware, iOS allows you to add certain predefined CTAs or buttons towards the bottom of each _Push Notification_ to facilitate seamless engagement. As shown below, you can leverage this functionality in 3 easy steps:

*   **Step 1:** Click the toggle switch to enable _Buttons_
    
*   **Step 2:** Select a relevant _Button Type_ for your campaign
    
*   **Step 3:** Deep-link it to a relevant app screen (you can also personalize the deep links to each user's preferences or behavioral history by following these steps)
    

**You can add either of the following (predefined) _Button pairs_ to a _Text_ or _Banner_ style _Push Notification_ for all iOS users:**

Opens the app and takes the users to the defined deep link, recorded as the campaign event, _Push Clicked_ in your dashboard.

**Download**

Takes the user to the deep link specified under _On-click-Action,_ and is tracked as the campaign event, _Push Clicked_ in your dashboard.

**Why can't custom buttons be added to a _Carousel_ or _Rating_ template?**

Given the highly interacted nature of these type of _Push Notifications,_ we have made it possible for you to customize the buttons, images, and links individually for each layout. Hence, adding buttons separately for iOS users will defeat the purpose of customization made while _Configuring the Carousel Layout_ or the _Rating Layout._

### 

Key-Value Pairs _(Deep Linking, Personalization)_

With _Key-Value pairs_, you can easily customize the contents of an app screen, personalize your _Push Notification_, deep link the notification to a specific app screen, web page and much more!

You can think of _Key-Value pairs_ as a set of linked data points in which the _Key_ acts as a unique identifier and the _Value_ either represents the data or points to the location of the data that is identified by the _Key._

The best part - these are not visible to your users. All this data is sent as an extra payload to your app, causing its code to perform the specified action and render the _Push Notification_ accordingly.

**Here's how you can go about it:**

Click to enlarge

**Step 1:** Enable _Key-Value pairs_ by clicking the _toggle button,_ as shown above.

**Step 2:** Add a _Key_ and its corresponding _Value,_ as understood by your app.

**Step 3:** Click the _Add Pair button_ to specify additional pairs.

*   For example, in the above visual, we have used the _Key, appurl_ to deep link the _Push Notification_ to a specific app screen, defined as the _Value._

### 

Preview Notification

Click to enlarge

As shown above, the left half of the campaign creation interface provides a real-time preview of the _Push Notification_ being created by you. At any given point, you can toggle between a **_Raw Preview_** and **_User Preview_** to gauge the notification's appearance for both **_iOS_** and **_Android_** users _(as per the target device selected at Step 1: Audience)._

#### 

Raw Preview

As the name suggests, it renders the _Push Notification_ with the raw message and attributes, as added by you to the _Title & Message._

Click to enlarge

#### 

User Preview

Allows you to view the _Notification_ for an actual user from your account by populating it with data from their user profile, as per the elements of personalization added to _Title & Message._

Click to enlarge

For example, in the visual above, we have visualized the _Push Notification's_ message for the _User ID, eyang\_2699._ Here's how you can go about it:

**Step 1:** Select _User Preview_ from the dropdown placed on the top left

*   In doing so, you will be prompted by a pop-up allowing you to search for a user to populate the corresponding attribute and event values.

**Step 2:** Enter the _User ID,_ preferably of a power user included within the target audience

*   Access _List of Users_ of the campaign's target Segment (as specified at _Step 1: Audience)_ to identify an ideal user.

**Step 3:** Click the _Search and Populate_ button

*   In doing so, you will be shown a summary of the values against the respective attributes and events included in the message. This is a good way to ensure that all the values are available for the user; if not then you can enter an alternate _User ID._

**Step 4:** Click the _See Preview_ button on the pop-up to visualize the notification with real user data

*   While this is a great way to gauge the overall look and feel of the _Push Notification,_ we recommend that you test the campaign with a test segment to ensure that it's good to go!

### 

Create Variations

_Variations_ are just different versions of the campaign's message that facilitate easy multivariate testing and are referred to in the following manner in your dashboard:

**Variation A:** The first version of the message.  
**Variation B:** The second version of the message.  
**Variation C, D, E:** Subsequent versions of the message created for testing.

Click to enlarge

As shown above, by default the message creation interface consists of a single _Variation A._

*   You can click on the _Plus icon_ to create up to 5 versions of the message.
    
    *   _Select **Create New** to start building the new Variation from scratch_
    *   _Select **Copy from Variation A** (or any of the previous versions) to make minor edits to the new Variation_
*   Each _Variation_ can be created independent of the other, allowing you to test multiple aspects like its layout, body copy, buttons, links and colors to identify a mix that resonates with your entire target audience. _(How to test message Variations)_
    
*   The percentage values indicate the share of users, that will receive a _Variation_ and can be customized at _Step 4: Conversion Tracking._
    

#### 

Test Message

You can easily test the message with an internal segment of users before sending it to your entire user base. As shown below, click the _Test Message_ button to _select a Variation_ and _Test Segment_. Please refer to this Step-by-step Guide to proceed.

Step 4: Set up Conversion Tracking & Variation Testing


----------------------------------------------------------

The fourth step of campaign creation allows you to measure the effectiveness of your campaign in various ways like:

*   _Tracking conversions for a specific goal_
*   _Comparing performance against a control group_
*   _Testing multiple variations of the message to identify a winning version_

Hence, it has been divided into two sections: **Conversion Tracking** and **Variation Distribution.** However, depending on the number of message _Variations_ created by you, the view of _Step 4: Conversion Tracking_ will vary:

#### 

When only 1 Variation Exists

As shown below, on proceeding to this step from _Step 3: Message,_ you will be welcomed by an interface on which _Conversion Tracking_ is disabled.

Click to enlarge

#### 

When Multiple Variations Exist

As shown below, on proceeding to this step from _Step 3: Message,_ you will be welcomed by an interface on which:

*   _Conversion Tracking_ is disabled
*   _Variation Distribution_ meter indicates the share of the audience that will receive each _Variation_

Click to enlarge

Now, let's get you acquainted with the workings of _Step 4: Conversion Tracking:_

### 

Conversion Tracking

> 🚧
> 
> Must Read
> 
> 
> ---------------
> 
> We recommend that you gain a broad understanding of how _Conversion Tracking_ works in your dashboard before proceeding. Doing so will lay a strong foundation for understanding whether or not you need to enable _Conversion Tracking_ for the campaign and its impact on _Revenue Tracking_.

By default, _Conversion Tracking_ is disabled for all _Push campaigns._ As shown below, you can use the toggle switch to enable it.

#### 

Step 1: Select a Conversion Event

The term, _Conversion Event_ is an alias that helps you identify the event you expect users to perform after receiving the _Push Notification._

Click to enlarge

As shown above, you can choose from a list of all the _Custom Events_ being tracked for your account to specify the campaign's conversion goal. For example, we have specified the campaign's conversion goal as the _custom event, Checkout - Completed._

> 📘
> 
> The following options can be selected here:
> 
> 
> -------------------------------------------------
> 
> *   **Custom** _(all the custom events being tracked for your account)_
>     
> *   **System** _(Session Started, User Login)_
>     

> 👍
> 
> Pro Tip
> 
> 
> -------------
> 
> We recommend that you map all the _Custom Events_, that record the occurrence of a monetary transaction in your app, as _Revenue Events_ in your dashboard. This will help ensure that selecting the respective events as the _Conversion Event_ of a campaign helps you track _Conversions_ and _Revenue_ for the campaign and its channel :)

#### 

Step 2: Add Attributes to the Conversion Event

Depending on the end goal of the campaign, you can choose to narrow down the scope of conversion to a specific action like _Puma Leggings Purchased, Jimmy Choo Pumps Purchased, Episode 3 Streamed, Chapter 7 Started_ and so on.

This can be done by adding _attribute filters_ to the selected _Conversion Event._ Here's how you can go about it:

Click to enlarge

**Step 1:** As shown above, click on the filter icon placed next to the drop down

*   In doing so, you will be prompted by a pop-up allowing you to select an attribute and specify its value.

> 📘
> 
> The following options can be selected here:
> 
> 
> -------------------------------------------------
> 
> *   **Custom** _(all the custom attributes attached to the custom event selected as the conversion event)_
>     
> *   **Time** _(Event Time)_
>     
> *   **Location** _(City, Country)_
>     

**Step 2:** As shown below, click _Add Filter_ to add more attributes to the event

*   You can club multiple event attributes by the _AND/OR logic_
*   This way only those users who perform the _Conversion Event_ in the context of _All/Either_ attribute filters will be considered towards the _Conversion_ numbers of the campaign

Click to enlarge

> 🚧
> 
> How It Works: Clubbing Event Attributes by AND/OR Logic
> 
> 
> -------------------------------------------------------------
> 
> **AND:** Clubbing multiple event attribute filters by the _AND logic_ helps you narrow down the scope of occurrence of the _Conversion Event._ This means that only those users will be counted towards the campaign's _Conversions_ who perform the _Conversion Event_ in the context of all the event attributes.
> 
> **OR:** Clubbing multiple event attribute filter by the _OR logic_ helps you widen the scope of occurrence of the _Conversion Event._ This means that users who perform the _Conversion Event_ in the context of any of the specified event attributes\* will be counted towards the campaign's conversions.

#### 

Step 3: Set Conversion Deadline

The _Conversion Deadline_ is a duration defined by you that tells us when to stop tracking conversions for a campaign.

*   This means that once your campaign is delivered, we will track users who perform the _Conversion Event_ in the context of its attribute filters (if any), only till the specified _Conversion Deadline._

Click to enlarge

As shown above, by default, a _Conversion Deadline of 7 days_ is set for all campaigns. You can choose to specify a custom duration in _Hours or Days,_ as per the campaign's end goal.

Step 4: Enable Control Group (Optional)

Click to enlarge

A _Control Group_ is a small portion of the target audience of a campaign that is randomly selected, representing the behavior and preferences of the entire segment, and does not receive the campaign.

An optional but recommended step, adding a _Control Group_ to the target audience allows you to compare the campaign's performance against the organic behavior of _Control Group_ users. This makes for the perfect benchmark to assess the true impact of the campaign on influencing user behavior.

> 📘
> --
> 
> Detailed read on Control Group.

On checking the Control Group checkbox, you are presented with another choice called 'Target Control Group', that lets you choose between two options.

*   Set a new control group for this campaign
*   Custom Control Group

**Option 1: Set a new control group for this campaign:** This will be a campaign level control group which means a control group that is created for a specific campaign only. The users in this control group are randomly added from the selected segment in 'Audience' tab. This control group is good if the aim is to measure impact for a specific campaign.

On clicking this option, the Variation Distribution slider is exposed that allows you to select percentage of users to be added in Control Group from target audience.

**Option 2: Custom Control Group:** This option is shown when at least one Custom Control Groups is created in your account. Click here for detailed read on creating custom control group.

Since this is a pre-created control group, overlapping users within this group and the target segment won't be receiving the campaigns.

Custom control groups are good for analyzing effectiveness of multiple campaigns. For example: Analyzing effectiveness of SMS and Email campaigns during Diwali sale.

Unlike Campaign level control group, the percentage of users to be part of control group cannot be controlled when Custom control group is selected.

###Variation Distribution (Multivariate Testing)

If you have created multiple versions of the _Push Notification_ at _Step 3: Message,_ then you can choose to automate the testing process by enabling _Send Winning Variation Automatically_. _Doing so will allow you to test all the \_Variations_(and _Control Group_ if enabled) with a smaller test audience and we will automatically send the winning variant to the entire target audience. \_(detailed read)\*

However, you can opt to test the _Variations_ and _Control Group_ manually if you are unable to automate testing due to the small size of the target audience (less than 2,000 users) of a _One-time_ or _Recurring campaign._ Or if you are unwilling to test a _Triggered campaign_ with a minimum of 500 messages.

####

>     

Depending on the campaign type selected when you initiated creation, the steps of configuring automated variation testing vary:

*   _One-time campaign_
*   _Triggered campaign_
*   _Recurring campaign_

#### 

Testing a One-time Campaign

Given the short lifespan of _one-time campaigns_, we suggest that you launch the campaign well in advance for testing, and schedule it for delivery at the most viable time slot (as suggested by the channel's engagement trends). Doing so will ensure that your users receive the most effective version of your campaign at a time that records the highest engagement rate.

Click to enlarge

**Step 1: Specify Size of Test Audience**  
You can choose to test the _Variations_ and _Control Group_ (if added) with **5% to 25%** of the campaign's entire target audience. As shown above, we have chosen to treat 15% of all users as the _Test Audience._

**Step 2: Define Time to Test**

A custom _test duration_ can be specified in _Minutes_ or _Hours._ As shown above, we have specified a test duration of _8 Hours._ This means that the impact of all the message _Variations_ and organic behavior of the _Control Group_ (if added) will be tracked for _8 Hours,_ after which we will determine a winner.

**Step 3: Select Win Criteria**

The _Win Criteria_ is a performance indicator that helps us determine a winning _Variation_ according to the campaign's end goal. As shown above, it can be defined as _Clicks_ or _Conversions,_ as per your needs.

> 🚧
> --
> 
> **Quick Read:** _How automated variation testing works for one-time campaigns_

#### 

Testing a Triggered Campaign

_Triggered campaigns_ are on-going cycles of communication that are sent to users only when they perform a certain action or _Event_. Thus, the most scientific way to test _Variations_ of a triggered campaign is by ensuring that a significant number of messages are delivered before we draw a comparison.

**Step 1: Specify Size of Test Audience**

The _Test Audience_ can be defined only in terms of the number of messages delivered. This means that _Variation_ testing will continue until the specified number of messages have been successfully delivered.

Click to enlarge

**Step 2: Select Win Criteria**

The _Win Criteria_ is a performance indicator that helps us determine a winning _Variation_ according to the campaign's end goal. As shown above, it can be defined as _Clicks_ or _Conversions,_ as per your needs.

*   Once we identify a winning _Variation_, it will be sent as the only campaign to all the subsequent users who perform the _trigger event_.

> 🚧
> --
> 
> **Quick Read:** _How automated variation testing works for triggered campaigns_

#### 

Testing a Recurring Campaign

If you choose to create a _Recurring campaign,_ then the entire first run of the campaign will be considered as its _Test Audience_ by default.

*   We will calculate the test results 1 hour before the second run of the campaign to identify a winning variation.
*   A winning _Variation_ will be determined as per the _Win Criteria_ and will be sent as the only campaign to all users from the second run. onwards.

Thus, as shown below, just define the _Win Criteria (Clicks or Conversions),_ we will take care of the rest!

#### 

Manual Distribution

If you are unable to set up _Send Winning Variation Automatically_ due to the small size of the target audience (less than 2,000 users) of a _One-time_ or _Recurring campaign,_ or if you are unwilling to test a _Triggered campaign_ with a minimum of 500 messages, then you can choose to test the _Variations_ manually.

Click to enlarge

As shown above, all the _Variations_ created in _Step 3: Message_ are equally divided amongst the entire target audience. Using the slider, you can choose to specify a custom share for each _Variation_ and _Control Group,_ if enabled.

> 🚧
> --
> 
> **Quick Read:** How manual _Variation Distribution_ works

Depending on your _Variation testing settings_, the campaign will be tested against the _Control Group_ in either of the following ways:

#### 

Impact on Variation Slider if Control group is enabled

In case the **Control Groups have been enabled** the Variation Distribution slider behaves differently based on the type of control group selected:

**If Campaign level control group is selected:** In this case, the user will have the option of adding the control group by deciding the percentage or size of the control group on variation distribution slider.

**If Custom Control Group is selected:** You will not be able to manually select the size of the control group using the variation slider since the Custom Control Group is pre-created and overlapping users in the selected Custom Control Group and target segment, won't be receiving the campaign.

> 🚧
> 
> Keep in mind
> 
> 
> ------------------
> 
> *   In a particular campaign, Custom Control Group and campaign control group cannot be applied together.
>     
> *   Universal control group can be added irrespective of Custom Control Group or Campaign Control Group is selected.
>     
> *   In case multiple control groups are applied within same campaign (E.g: Universal Control Group + Custom Control Group or Universal Control Group + Campaign control): In this case, since the users in both the control group are mutually exclusive, the overall control group size will increase and the target audience size will decrease.

Step 5: Test Your Campaign (Recommended)


--------------------------------------------

Iron out all the creases in your _Push Notification_ by testing it with internal team members for maximum impact!

Click to enlarge

While this is an optional step, we recommend that you test all campaigns that contain images, buttons, deep links, and elements of personalization in the message to ensure that everything's in order. This can be easily done by creating a _Test Segment_ and adding all the stakeholders.

However, you can always choose to skip it by clicking the _Skip Test & Proceed_ button, as highlighted above. Doing so will take you to the final step of campaign creation - _Step 6: Preview & Launch._

**Now, let's show you how you can test all the message _Variations_:**

#### 

Step 5.1.: Select a Variation

By default, _Variation A_ is selected against the field - _Variation To Test._

However, if you have created multiple _Variations_, you can test each by sending them consecutively to a _Test Segment._ For example, in the visual above, we have chosen to test _Variation D_ of our _Push Notification._

#### 

Step 5.2.: Select Test Segment

As shown above, all the test segments created while testing a campaign, for any channel _(Push, SMS, Web Push, Email, WhatsApp),_ can be found under the dropdown, _Send Test Message To,_ along with details of all its users.

#### 

Step 5.3.: Personalize Test Message

Click to enlarge

As highlighted above, you can test personalization in two ways:

*   **Use own data of users included in the test segment** to receive a message personalized to your user profile
*   **Use data of a specific user** to receive the exact message that the selected user would receive
    *   On selecting this option, you will be prompted to search for a user in your database.
    *   We recommend selecting this option if you have personalized the message to a very specific set of custom events or users attributes that are unlikely to be available for an internal team member.

**Here's how you can personalize the message to a specific user:**

**Step 1:** Click on the _Search User button_

*   In doing so, you will be prompted to search your user base.

**Step 2:** Add the _User ID,_ preferably of a power user included within the target audience

*   Access _List of Users_ of the campaign's target _Segment_ (as specified at _Step 1: Audience)_ to identify an ideal user

Click to enlarge

**Step 3:** Click the _Search and Populate Values button_

*   In doing so, you will be shown a summary of the values against the respective attributes and events included in the message. This is a good way to ensure that all the values are available for the user. If not, then you can enter an alternate _User ID_ to personalize the message.
*   Next, click the _Save and Return to Test Campaign_ button to proceed with the selected user.

**Step 4:** Click the _Send Test & Proceed button_ to test the campaign.

> ---------------------------------------------------------------------
> 
> As you are aware, all the data stored in your WebEngage is either gleaned from your integrated apps and website or can be manually uploaded as a CSV file. Thus, it may so happen that details of internal teammates may not be readily available in your dashboard (even if they are account admins).
> 
> Hence, we recommend that you request teammates to sign up on your platform so that we can populate their _User Profiles_ with their personal and behavioral data. Doing so will come in handy when:

**Step 1:** Name Your Test Segment  
As shown below, the segment's name is prefixed with _'TEST -'_ and can be customized henceforth. For example, we have named our segment, _TEST - Design team._

Click to enlarge

**Step 2:** Add Internal Users Through Filters

As shown above, you can segment internal members by manually adding their _**User ID, Email Address** or **Phone Number**_ (the chosen filter will depend on the _Unique Identifier_ or the parameter that helps identify users in your WebEngage account, as specified by you).

For example, in the above visual, we have selected _User ID_ as the filter and have toggled between the _List of Users_ (nested under _Users)_ and the campaign creation interface to identify and add the respective _User IDs_ to the test segment, _Test - Design Team._

**Step 3:** Click on the _Create Test Segment_ button.

> We recommend that you leverage the diverse device preferences of your teammates to test the _Push Notification_ on multiple devices (mobile, tablet), varying screen sizes, app versions and OS (Android, iOS) to ensure that it looks stunning all across!

#### 

Editing Test Segment

**Step 1:** As shown below, click the _Edit icon_ placed next to the field - _Send Test Message To_ to edit the users included within the selected _Test Segment._

*   In doing so, you will be prompted by a pop-up, pre-populated with details of existing users.

Click to enlarge

**Step 2:** As shown above, make all your changes and click the _Update Test Segment button_ to proceed. For example, we have added new members to the segment, _TEST - Content team._

#### 

Deleting Test Segment

Click to enlarge

**Step 1:** As shown below, click the _Bin icon_ placed next to the field - _Send Test Message To_ to delete the selected _Test Segment._

*   In doing so, you will be prompted to confirm your decision.

**Step 2:** Click the _Delete Segment_ button on the pop-up.

*   In doing so, a notification will pop-up on the bottom right confirming the deletion.

Step 6: Preview & Launch


----------------------------

Once you are satisfied with the test results, it's time to send the _Push Notification_ to your users! But before that, we recommend that you conduct a quick preview of the campaign's message and settings to ensure that it's in line with your end goal.

The last step of campaign creation presents a snapshot of its:

*   Target apps and segment _(Step 1: Audience)_
*   _Campaign Type, Delivery Time, Frequency Capping, DND Hours_ and _Queueing_ settings _(Step 2: When)_
*   Message _Variations_ and OS-wise preview _(Step 3: Message)_
*   _Conversion Tracking_ and multivariate test settings _(Step 4: Conversion Tracking)_

#### 

Edit Campaign Before Launch

You can always choose to edit a step by clicking on the _Pencil icon,_ placed next to each step's header. In doing so, you will be directed back to the step, as shown below.

Click to enlarge

Simply make your edits, save them, toggle back to _Step 6: Preview & Launch_ to continue your review, as shown above.

#### 

Saving Campaign as a Draft

If you're unsure or are awaiting approval of the campaign's contents, then you can simply go back to the _central hub of Push_ after saving your settings, as shown below. Doing so will automatically save the campaign as a _Draft,_ allowing you to edit or launch it anytime you like.

#### 

Launching Scheduled Campaigns

If you have chosen to schedule/ start the campaign at a later date-time, then on launching it, its status will indicate _Upcoming_ in _Push, List of Campaigns_, as shown below.
