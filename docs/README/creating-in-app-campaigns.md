=========================

A step-by-step guide on creating In-app Notifications in your dashboard

Suggest Edits

Engaging users with _In-app Notifications_ is an effective way to keep active users engaged with contextual messages (related to their latest app interactions). Your dashboard comes with a highly intuitive 5-step campaign creation interface that makes it easy to create and execute highly personalized campaigns in minutes!

> 🚧
> 
> Must Read
> 
> 
> ---------------
> 
> At WebEngage, we are obsessed with enabling consumer business, like yours, to create personalized and contextual experiences that facilitate retention-led growth. This is why user data _(User Attributes)_, behavioral data _(Events & Event Attributes)_ and _Segments_ play an integral role in campaign creation. We recommend that you get yourself acquainted with the respective concepts before proceeding.

**Here's a quick summary of the exciting possibilities offered by the campaign creation interface:**

*   **Create highly targeted messages,** tailored to each user's app interactions in real time! _(skip to Step 2: When)_
    
*   Leverage ready-to-use templates to **engage users with rich In-app Notifications** _(skip to Step 3: Message, Layout)_
    
*   **Personalize messages** to each user's preferences and behavior, across the various stages of their lifecycle _(skip to Step 3: Message)_
    
*   **Deep link the _Notification_** to specific screens in your app _(skip to Step 3: Message)_
    
*   **Automate multivariate message testing** for your campaign - we'll automatically identify a winner and send it to the entire audience _(skip to Step 4: Conversion Tracking & Variation Distribution)_
    

**How to Access**

As shown below, the campaign creation interface can be accessed by clicking the _Plus icon_ placed on the top left of _List of Campaigns,_ or the central hub of _In-app._

Click to enlarge

Now, let's walk you through all the steps of campaign creation.

Step 1: Define the Audience


===============================

Click to enlarge

1\. Name your Campaign


--------------------------

The first step is to give your campaign a unique name that helps you identify its purpose.

2\. Select Target Devices


-----------------------------

As shown above, you can choose to create campaigns exclusively for your _Android_ or _iOS_ users by specifying a _Target Device._ The following options can be selected here:

*   Both Android & iOS
*   Android only
*   iOS only

Click to enlarge

3\. Select Target Apps


--------------------------

> 📘
> 
> Please Note
> 
> 
> -----------------
> 
> This option will show only if you have integrated multiple Android/ iOS apps while configuring In-app & target a few of these through the campaign selectively

#### 

3A. Specify Target Android Apps

If you have added multiple app credentials while configuring _In-app for Android,_ then by default, all the apps will be targeted. You can alter this by removing _Android Package Names_ to target specific apps with the message. You will see the following two options:

*   **Send to all apps** send the _In-app Notifications_ to all the configured apps.
*   **Send to specific apps** will send the notification to the particular apps of your choice. You can select which apps the notification will be sent to by clicking on the _Pencil_ icon. A new modal will open with the list of apps, letting you choose them by selecting or deselecting them. You can also search the _Package Name_ through the search bar. Click _Save_ to save the changes as shown below.

Click to enlarge

This field is hidden if you have selected iOS only under _Target Devices._

> 📘
> 
> Please Note
> 
> 
> -----------------
> 
> You can choose up to 20 apps at a time.

#### 

3B. Specify Target iOS Apps

If you have added multiple app credentials while configuring _In-app for iOS,_ then by default all the apps will be selected here as target apps. You can choose to remove the respective _iOS Bundle Identifiers_ to target select apps with the message. You will see the following two options:

*   **Send to all apps** send the _In-app Notifications_ to all the configured apps.
*   **Send to specific apps** will send the notification to the particular apps of your choice. You can select which apps the notification will be sent to by clicking on the _Pencil_ icon. A new modal will open with the list of apps, letting you choose the apps by selecting or deselecting them. You can also search the _Package Name_ through the search bar. Click _Save_ to save the changes as shown below.

Click to enlarge

This field is hidden if you have selected Android only under _Target Devices._

> 📘
> 
> Please Note
> 
> 
> -----------------
> 
> You can choose up to 20 apps at a time.

4\. Define Target Audience (Send To)


----------------------------------------

One of the key differentiators of successful campaigns is that they're tailored to the behavior and preferences of a specific group of users. Thus, you can create highly contextual _In-app Notifications_ for a specific segment of users by selecting the _Segment_ or _Lists_ from the dropdown placed beside, _Send To,_ as shown below.

> 📘
> 
> Please Note
> 
> 
> -----------------
> 
> To use **Lists** as Target Audience you have to ensure that the SDKs are updated to:
> 
> *   Android: 4.17.0 or later
> *   iOS: 6.13.0 or later

Click to enlarge

As shown above, on selecting a segment, you will be able to preview a snapshot of _Reachable Users_ and the _Rules of Segmentation._ Let's quickly walk you through **Segment Preview**:

*   **Reachable Users:** Indicates the number of users, from the selected segment, that can be engaged through _In-app Messaging_ as a channel, at present.
    
*   **Rules of Segmentation:** You can choose to segment your entire user base by 3 broad parameters - User (attributes), Behavior and Technology. Thus, _Segment Preview_ presents a snapshot of all the users, against the parameters based on which, they have been grouped together.
    

#### 

Edit Segment

Click on the _Edit icon,_ placed next to the dropdown, _Send To,_ to edit the selected _Segment._ In doing so, you will be prompted by a pop-up, pre-populated with the existing rules of segmentation, as shown below.

Click to enlarge

Simply make your edits and click _Save_ to proceed. In doing so, you will be able to preview the number of reachable users as per your edits.

#### 

Create a New Segment

You can choose to create a new _Segment \_of users from the campaign creation interface by clicking the \_Create Segment button._ In doing so you will be prompted by a pop-up, allowing you to build a new segment, as shown below.

Click to enlarge

Once created, you will be able to access the _Segment_ through the _List of Segments_ in your dashboard.

> 🚧
> 
> Related Read: Rules of Segmentation
> 
> 
> -----------------------------------------
> 
> Please refer to _Creating Segments_ for step-by-step guidance on how you can segment your users by their attributes, behavior (events), and technological preferences.

#### 

Creating a New, Single-use Segment

You can also choose to create disposable segments or segment users specifically for the campaign and avoid adding it to the _List of Segments_ in your dashboard.

Click to enlarge

As shown above, this can be achieved by leaving the field, _Name_ blank while creating the segment. In doing so, it will become an _Ad hoc segment_ in your dashboard which will be available only for sending the campaign you're currently creating.

#### 

Apply Universal Control Group

> 📘
> 
> Conditional Option
> 
> 
> ------------------------
> 
> This is a conditional option which will be shown only if the you have created Universal control group in your account. Click here to know how to create Universal control group.

Click to enlarge

*   **When the box is checked:** the campaign will not be sent to users who are part of the Universal Control Group in the segment that is selected.
*   **When the box is unchecked:** the campaign will be sent to all users that are part of the segment inclusive of the Universal Control Group users.

Step 2: Specify When to Show, Which Screen to Show on & How Many Times to Show


==================================================================================

Given the highly targeted nature of _In-app Notifications,_ they have been categorized as _Triggered campaigns_ across your dashboard. These are on-going cycles of communication that are triggered for a specific user only when they:

*   Perform a certain action or a combination of several actions _(Custom Events)_ in your app _(Configure for your campaign)_
    
*   Spend a certain amount of time browsing through your app or a specific screen in a session _(Configure for your campaign)_
    
*   Visit a specific screen in your app _(Configure for your campaign)_
    
*   Visit a specific number of screens (2, 3, 4...) in a session _(Configure for your campaign)_
    
*   Perform a combination of a few/all the conditions listed above
    

This makes _In-app_ an ideal channel to create contextual app experiences that enable users to move along their lifecycle and stay engaged for longer durations.

Click to enlarge

As highlighted above, we have divided _Step 2: When_ into two sections:

*   Campaign Schedule _(helps you determine the lifespan of the campaign)_
*   Where and When to Show _(helps you define the targeting rules, where, when & how many times to show the message in your app)_

Here's how you can configure these settings:

1\. Setup Campaign Schedule


-------------------------------

Since all _In-app Campaigns_ are on-going cycles of communication, you can choose to run these for specific periods of time by defining a _Start Date_ and _End Date._

**Step 1:** Specify the _Start Date_ or the date-time on which the campaign should start getting shown to the target audience. As highlighted below:

*   _Select **Now** to activate the campaign immediately_
*   _Select **Later** to activate the campaign at a later date-time_

Click to enlarge

**Step 2:** Specify the _End Date_ or the date-time on which the campaign should cease getting shown to the target audience. As highlighted above:

*   _Select **Never** to run the campaign indefinitely_ (you can always _Pause_ the campaign through its _Campaign Overview)_
*   _Select **Later** to end the campaign at a specific date and time in the near future_

2\. Specify Where & When to Show


------------------------------------

These settings allow you to specify the app screens on which the message must be shown and the context in which users will receive it.

Click to enlarge

As highlighted above:

*   _Select **Show on any screen as soon as the user opens the app** to engage them as soon they start their session_
    
*   _Select **Show on specific screens and/or show when specific conditions are met** to engage users only in the context of their app interactions, in real-time_
    
    *   Selecting this option allows you to configure the following rules:
        *   **Where to Show** _(Define the screen(s) on which the message will be shown to users)_
        *   **When to Show** _(Define the context in which users will be shown the message)_

Let's show you how you can configure these options:

> 🚧
> --
> 
> **Skip to** _3\. Specify How Many Times to Show (Show Limit)_ to complete \*Step 2: When, of the campaign creation process.

#### 

Step 2.1: Where to Show

> 🚧
> 
> Please Note
> 
> 
> -----------------
> 
> This rule can be configured only if you have selected,**Show on specific screens and/or show when specific conditions are met** under _2\. Where & When to Show_

Here you can define exactly where you'd like to show the _In-app Message_ by specifying names of app screens and/or data points (tracked across your app) that indicate specific user-app interactions.

Click to enlarge

As highlighted above:

*   _Select **On screens that meet certain Screen Name conditions** to show the message only on specific app screens (How it works)_
    
*   _Select **On screens that meet certain Screen Data conditions** to show the message only when users interact with your app in a specific way, no matter which screen (How it works)_
    
*   _Select **both options** to show the message on specific app screens when users interact with them in a certain way (How it works)_
    

#### 

In-app Targeting by Specifying _Screen Name_

You can choose to selectively engage users who visit a specific screen or a combination of related screens, in an on-going session. Here's how you can configure this targeting rule:

Click to enlarge

**Step 1:** Click the checkbox to select the option, **On screens that meet certain _Screen Name_ conditions** against _Where to Show_

**Step 2:** As shown above, select a condition to set the context in which the _Screen Name(s)_ should be understood by your app.

> 📘
> 
> Screen Names can be prefixed by any one of the following conditions:
> 
> 
> --------------------------------------------------------------------------
> 
> *   Equal to
>     
> *   Not equal to
>     
> *   One of
>     
> *   None of
>     
> *   Starts with
>     
> *   Does not start with
>     
> *   Ends with
>     
> *   Does not end with
>     
> *   Matches regex _(regex is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern - used in several coding languages. Detailed read)_
>     
> *   Does not match regex
>     
> *   Contains
>     
> *   Does not contain
>     
> *   Is empty _(implies that message can be shown on any screen that has not been tagged with a name in your app's code)_
>     
> *   Is not empty _(implies that message can be shown on any app screen that has been tagged with a name in your app's code)_
>     

**Step 3:** Add the Screen Name(s), as tagged in your app's code

*   Please check in with your tech team to ensure that the values entered here match the names in the code. Any discrepancy between the two can cause your campaign to fail or show up randomly across your app, leading to confusing user experiences.

**Step 4 (Optional):** Click the _Add Condition_ button to add more _Screen Names_ to the targeting rules

*   In doing so, a new row will be added to the screen. Repeat _Step 2 & 3_ and proceed.
*   Further, you can choose to club multiple _Screen Names_ by the AND/OR logic to define the scope of _In-app_ targeting.

> 🚧
> 
> How It Works: Clubbing Screen Names by AND/OR Logic
> 
> 
> ---------------------------------------------------------
> 
> *   **AND:** Clubbing _Screen Names_ by the AND logic helps you narrow down the number of users who receive the _In-app Notification._ It implies that a user will have to _visit all the specified Screens, in any order,_ to receive the campaign.
>     
> *   **OR:** Clubbing _Screen Names_ by the OR logic helps you increase the number of users who receive the _In-app Notification._ It implies that a user will receive the campaign if they _visit any one of the specified Screen Names._
>     

> 🚧
> --
> 
> **Skip to** configuring _When to Show_ to define the context in which a user should receive the _In-app Notification_

#### 

In-app Targeting by Specifying _Screen Data Attribute_

Depending on the end-goal of your campaign, you can choose to engage only those users who interact with your app in a specific manner, no matter which screen they're on. This can be achieved by tracking app-user interactions as _Screen Data Attributes._ Here's how you can configure this targeting rule:

Click to enlarge

**Step 1:** Click the checkbox to select the option, **On screens that meet certain _Screen Data_ conditions** against _Where to Show_

**Step 2:** As shown above, add the _Screen Data Attribute(s),_ as tracked in your app's code

*   Please check in with your tech team to ensure that the values entered here match the values in the code. Any discrepancy between the two can cause your campaign to fail or show up randomly across your app, leading to confusing user experiences.

**Step 3:** Select the appropriate data type, as conveyed by your tech team (so that your app understands the value of the specified _Screen Data Attribute)_

> 📘
> 
> Any one of the following data types can be selected here:
> 
> 
> ---------------------------------------------------------------
> 
> *   **Number:** Indicates that the value of the specified data attribute contains only numbers.
>     
> *   **String:** Indicates that the value of the specified data attribute contains text, numbers, special characters, spaces or a combination of these.
>     
> *   **Boolean:** Indicates that the specified data attribute has one of two possible values denoted by `true` or `false`.
>     
> *   **Date:** Indicates that the value of the specified data attribute contains a date/date-time.
>     

**Step 4 (Optional):** Click the _Add Condition_ button to add more _Screen Data Attributes_ to the targeting rules

*   In doing so, a new row will be added to the interface. Repeat _Steps 2 & 3_ to proceed.
*   Further, you can choose to club multiple _Screen Data Attributes_ by the AND/OR logic to define the scope of _In-app_ targeting.

> 🚧
> 
> How It Works: Clubbing Screen Data Attributes by AND/OR Logic
> 
> 
> -------------------------------------------------------------------
> 
> *   **AND:** Clubbing _Screen Data Attributes_ by the AND logic helps you narrow down the number of users who receive the _In-app Notification._ It implies that a user will have to _meet all the specified Screen Data conditions_ to receive the campaign.
>     
> *   **OR:** Clubbing _Screen Data Attributes_ by the OR logic helps you increase the number of users who receive the _In-app Notification._ It implies that a user will receive the campaign only if they _meet any one of the specified Screen Data conditions._
>     

> 🚧
> --
> 
> **Skip to** configuring _When to Show_ to define the context in which a user should receive the _In-app Notification_

Thus, whenever a user visits a screen that contains the term _'\_listing'_ in their tagged _Screen Name_ AND happens to explore any of the specified _Sub-category IDs,_ they'll be nudged with the _Free Shipping offer!_

#### 

Step 2.2: When to Show

> 🚧
> 
> Please Note
> 
> 
> -----------------
> 
> This rule can be configured only if you have selected,**Show on specific screens and/or show when specific conditions are met** under _2\. Where & When to Show_

Here you can define the context in which the _In-app Notification_ must be shown to a user during an on-going session. This could be anything like - total time spent on a screen or in the app, a particular action _(Custom Event)_ performed by the user, and so on.

Click to enlarge

As highlighted above:

*   _Select **Total time spent on a screen in a session by a user is seconds** to display the message only once the specified duration is exceeded_
    
*   _Select **Total time spent on your app in a session by a user is seconds** to display the message only once the specified duration is exceeded_
    
*   _Select **Number of screens viewed in a session by a user is <select value>,** to display the message only once the specified criteria is met_
    
*   _Select **User does one or more events** to display the message only if the user performs an action (Custom Event) or a combination of several actions (in any order), in the context of the added Event Attribute filter(s), during a session (How it works)_
    
*   _Select **all or multiple options** to display the message when a user's actions match any one of the configured rules_
    
    *   For example, in the visual above, the _In-app Notification_ will be shown to all users who _have spent more than 10 secs on a screen OR have spent more than 30 secs on the app OR have viewed more than 5 screens OR have performed the event, Browse._

#### 

Triggering In-app Notification When User Performs an Event or Multiple Events

Selecting the option, **User does one or more events** against _When to Show,_ allows you to engage only those users of the target audience that perform specific actions in your app, in a session. These actions _(Custom Events)_ could be anything like _Browse, Search, Page\_Viewed, Product\_Viewed, Checkout\_Started, Wishlist\_Viewed_ and so on.

Here's how you can configure this rule:

Click to enlarge

**Step 1:** Click the dropdown nested under the option to select a _Custom Events (in the context of which users will receive the message)_

**Step 2 (Optional):** Click the _Filter icon_ to add _Custom Attribute filters_ to the selected Event

*   Further, you can choose to club multiple event attributes by the AND/ OR logic to define the scope of occurrence of the event. Doing so ensures that the _In-app Notification_ is triggered for a user only when they perform the event in the context of the applied attribute filters.

> 🚧
> 
> How It Works: Clubbing Custom Event Attributes by AND/OR Logic
> 
> 
> --------------------------------------------------------------------
> 
> **AND:** Clubbing attribute filters by the AND logic helps you narrow down the number of users who receive the message. It implies that the _In-app campaign_ will be shown to only those users who perform the _Custom Event_ in the context of all the event attributes added to it.
> 
> **OR:** Clubbing attribute filters by the OR logic helps you increase the number of users who receive the message. It implies that a user will receive the campaign if they perform the _Custom Event_ in the context of any one of the specified event attributes.

**Step 3 (Optional):** Click the _Add Event_ button to specify more actions

*   In doing so, a dropdown will be added to the screen, allowing you to select from a list of all the _Custom Events_ being tracked for your account. Repeat _Step 2 & 3_ to proceed.
*   Further, you can club multiple _Custom Events_ by the AND/OR logic to define the context in which the occurrence of all specified events should be understood by us.

3\. Advanced Control for App Personalisation Channels


---------------------------------------------------------

We have now added additional controls to our In-app Notifications, that will allow you to define a campaign's view limits, recur campaigns, etc. Here is more information on the specifics of the feature.

_Lifecycle_ is an enhancement to our earlier ‘Max Limit’ option. This feature is a campaign level setting that allows you to set the number of times a notification is to be shown to a user and whether it should be repeated/ recurred. This can be set using the following two choices:

*   **A Cycle Ends when Clicked Once with No View Limit:** When you select this option, your users will keep receiving the notification (in every new session) until they click on it once. If they have either viewed or dismissed the notification, the cycle will persist.
*   **A Cycle Ends when Clicked Once or Viewed up to 'n' times:** When you select this option, you have the flexibility to determine the maximum number of times a notification should be viewed by a user. However, the cycle concludes with just one click. Let's illustrate this with an example: If you set the view count to 5, your users can potentially view the campaign notification up to 5 times. But, if they click on the notification during the 4th viewing, the cycle ends, and they won't encounter it for the 5th time.

**Repeat the cycle**  
Once you've made the previous selections, you also have the flexibility to determine the frequency at which your cycle repeats—options include **Hourly, Daily, Weekly, or Monthly**; these resets occur based on the calendar week that starts from Monday to Sunday and not when the user views them. Moreover, you can decide the duration of this repetition: either _'Until the campaign ends' \_or the_ 'Upto'\_ option.

> 👍
> 
> Here's an example of what happens when you choose either of the options
> 
> 
> -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
> 
> **Example 1:** _If you choose to repeat the cycle ‘Daily’ and 'Until the campaign ends,'_ your users will receive the notification every day until the campaign concludes. Consider the same scenario as the previous example, the notification will be sent to your user upto 5 times in a day (in different sessions), but when they’ve clicked it on their 4th viewing, they won’t be seeing it for the 5th time **on that day**. However the next day the counter will reset and user will again become eligible to view the campaign upto 5 times or until clicked once. This cycle will continue until the campaign ends.
> 
> **Example 2:** _If you choose the 'Weekly' option and 'Upto' 3 times_ then, considering the previous example, a user can view the notification up to 5 times a week (as per calendar week) but if they click on it, for instance, on their 4th viewing on Tuesday, they won't see it for the rest of the week (until Sunday). But because the cycle is set to repeat weekly, it will restart again at the start of the new calendar week i.e Monday. Now consider following scenarios for Week 2, 3 and 4 -
> 
> Week 2 - User completes all 5 view across the week but never clicks  
> Week 3 - User never opens the app. (This will be counted in the cycle)  
> Week 4 - User views the campaign once and clicks on it
> 
> Since the limit of repeating the cycle was **'Upto 3'**, the user will no longer be viewing the campaign after 4th week's 1st view (since the campaign was clicked).

> 
> If your message is in a language that incorporates right-to-left alignment, then it will automatically be oriented that way when users receive the _In-app Notification!_

#### 

Add Title & Description

_(Applicable to all Layouts except Screen Blocker | Number of characters accepted for each Layout differs, details)_

Click to enlarge

Using the personalization icon nested in the fields, **Title** and **Description**, you can easily create dynamically personalized content. Simply select a value from a list of all the _Custom User attributes\_and_ Custom Events\_ being tracked for your app and place them appropriately within the text. We'll add the exact value tracked for each user, helping you deliver one-on-one messages at scale :)

Click to enlarge

For example, in the above visual, we have personalized the message with: User attribute, **First Name** - `{{user['system']['first_name']}}`

Thus, whenever the message is sent to a user, we will populate the _First Name_ with the respective values gleaned for their user profile.

#### 

Add Icon/ Background Image

_(Icon & Image specs for each Layout)_

Click to enlarge

As shown above, a generic Icon/Image can be added in two ways:

**1\. Insert Icon/ Image Link:** The image must be hosted on a crawlable/publicly accessible domain to ensure that it renders for all users receiving the message.

**2\. Upload Icon/ Image:** Click the _Upload_ button placed next to the field, image and select a file from your desktop. In doing so, the image will get hosted on WebEngage's domain: _https://afiles.webengage.com_.

Click to enlarge

#### 

User Preview

Allows you to view the _Notification_ for an actual user from your account by populating it with data from their user profile, as per the elements of personalization added to the _Message._

Click to enlarge

For example, in the visual above, we have visualized the _In-app Notification_ for the _User ID, katherinem\_2206,_ personalizing the _Icon Image, Button Link_ and _Message._ Here's how you can go about it:

**Step 1:** Select _User Preview_ from the dropdown placed on the top left

*   In doing so, you will be prompted by a pop-up allowing you to search for a user to populate the corresponding attribute and event values.

**Step 2:** Enter the _User ID,_ preferably of a power user included within the target audience

*   Access _List of Users_ of the campaign's target segment (as specified at _Step 1: Audience)_ to identify an ideal user

**Step 3:** Click the _Search and Populate_ button

*   In doing so, you will be shown a summary of the values against the respective attributes and events included in the message. This is a good way to ensure that all the values are available for the user, if not then you can enter an alternate _User ID._

**Step 4:** Click the _See Preview_ button on the pop-up to visualize the notification with real user data.

Configure Buttons (CTA) & Close Button


------------------------------------------

Barring _Footer Style Notifications,_ you can add customized buttons to all the _In-app Layouts_ being created by you. As shown below, you can also choose to disable the _Buttons_ for all _Layouts_ if the end goal of the campaign is to simply convey information.

Click to enlarge

**Here's how you can configure CTAs:**

> 🚧
> --

> Or **skip to** deep linking entire _footer style notification_ to a specific app screen

#### 

Setting up Call-to-Action Buttons (Primary/Secondary)

**Step 1: Add Label (Text):** _Label_ refers to the button text, motivating users to perform a certain action. As shown above, we have added a custom label, _BUY NOW_ nudging active users to start shopping before the sale ends!

**Step 2: Insert Deep Link (On-click Action):** You can deep link buttons to specific screens in your _Android_ and _iOS apps,_ as shown above.

Further, you will notice that the deep link specified for the _Android app_ is in a different format compared to the _iOS_ link. This is because we have created a unique _URI_ for our _Android app screens_ while we are leveraging _Universal Links_ for the iOS app (the same link is also used for our website).

Setting Up Close Button

_(Applicable only to Header & Classic Modal)_

It's always advisable to allow users to close _In-app Notifications_ to ensure that they continue browsing instead of quitting your app. However, in case you'd like to force specific behavior like _app updates, joining a live class/session, renewing video streaming subscription_ and so on, then you can always choose to hide the button by clicking the toggle switch, as shown below.

Further, you can customize the button's label or text to anything you like. For example, we have changed it to a more subtle term, _NO, THANKS_ for our notification.

> 
> Here's how you can go about it:

Configuring Close Icon

_(Applicable only to Footer, Screen Blocker & Full-screen Modal Layouts)_

**Close Icon:** It's always advisable to allow users to close _In-app Notifications_ to ensure that they continue browsing instead of quitting your app. However, in case you'd like to force specific behavior like _app updates, joining a live class/session, renewing video streaming subscription_ and so on, then you can always choose to hide the close icon by selecting _Hide,_ as shown below.

Creating Custom HTML Templates

(Supported only for Classic Modal and Full screen Modal)

> 📘
> 
> Please Note
> 
> 
> -----------------
> 
> JavaScripts are now supported for in-apps, allowing you to create engaging experiences with spin the wheel, carousel, scratch card, and more.

If you would like to run some use cases, which cannot be fulfilled through our Preset templates, then _Custom HTML_ template gives you that flexibility. Custom HTML gives you the capability to completely own up the content area and run engaging in-app notification campaigns as per your use cases. With these Custom templates, you can add GIFs or run Videos within in-app notifications.

To create a campaign with custom template:

*   Create a in-app notification campaign
*   On Message tab, Select the layout type as Classic or Full screen
*   Select the Template as 'Custom HTML' and add the content body in Raw HTML format.

### 

Preview Notification

As shown below, the left half of the campaign creation interface provides a real-time preview of the _In-app Notification_ being created by you.

Click to enlarge

At any given point, you can toggle between a **_Raw Preview_** and **_User Preview_** to gauge the notification's appearance for both **_iOS_** and **_Android_** users _(as per the target device selected at Step 1: Audience)._

### 

Create Variations

_Variations_ are just different versions of the campaign's message that facilitate easy multivariate testing and are referred to in the following manner in your dashboard:

**Variation A:** The first version of the message.  
**Variation B:** The second version of the message.  
**Variation C, D, E:** Subsequent versions of the message created for testing.

Click to enlarge

As shown above, by default the message creation interface consists of a single _Variation A._

*   You can click on the _Plus icon_ to create up to 5 versions of the message.
    
    *   _Select **Create New** to start building the new Variation from scratch_
        *   In doing so, you will be prompted to select a _Layout_ to draft the particular variant
    *   _Select **Copy from Variation A** (or any of the previous versions) to make minor edits to the new Variation_
*   Each _Variation_ can be created independent of the other, allowing you to test multiple aspects like its layout, body copy, buttons, links and colors to identify a mix that resonates with your entire target audience. _(How to test message Variations)_
    
*   The percentage values indicate the share of users, that will receive a _Variation_ and can be customized at _Step 4: Conversion Tracking._
    

Step 4: Set up Conversion Tracking & Variation Testing


==========================================================

The fourth step of campaign creation allows you to measure the effectiveness of your campaign in various ways like:

*   _Tracking conversions for a specific goal_
*   _Comparing performance against a control group_
*   _Testing multiple variations of the message and identify a winning version_

Hence, it has been divided into two sections: **Conversion Tracking** and **Variation Distribution.** However, depending on the number of message _Variations_ created by you, the view of _Step 4: Conversion Tracking_ will vary:

#### 

When only 1 Variation Exists

As shown below, on proceeding to this step from _Step 3: Message,_ you will be welcomed by an interface on which _Conversion Tracking_ is disabled.

*   Click the toggle button to enable the setting and configure it.

Click to enlarge

#### 

When Multiple Variations Exist

As shown below, on proceeding to this step from _Step 3: Message,_ you will be welcomed by an interface on which:

*   _Conversion Tracking_ is disabled
*   _Variation Distribution_ meter indicates the share of the audience that will receive each _Variation_

Click the toggle button to enable the respective settings and configure them.

> ---------------
> 
> We recommend that you gain a broad understanding of how _Conversion Tracking_ works in your dashboard before proceeding. Doing so will lay a strong foundation for understanding whether or not you need to enable _Conversion Tracking_ for the campaign and its impact on _Revenue Tracking_.

By default, _Conversion Tracking_ is disabled for all _In-app campaigns._ As shown below, you can use the toggle switch to enable it.

Click to enlarge

#### 

Step 1: Select a Conversion Event

The term, _Conversion Event_ is an alias that helps you identify the event you expect users to perform after receiving the _In-app Message._

As shown above, you can choose from a list of all the _Custom Events_ being tracked for your account to specify the campaign's conversion goal. For example, we have specified the campaign's conversion goal as the _custom event, Checkout - Completed._

> 📘
> 
> The following options can be selected here:
> 
> 
> -------------------------------------------------
> 
> *   **Custom** _(all the custom events being tracked for your account)_
>     
> *   **System** _(Session Started, User Login)_

> 👍
> 
> Pro Tip
> 
> 
> -------------
> 
> We recommend that you map all the _Custom Events_, that record the occurrence of a monetary transaction in your app, as _Revenue Events_ in your dashboard. This will help ensure that selecting the respective events as the _Conversion Event_ of a campaign helps you track _Conversions_ and _Revenue_ for the campaign and its channel :)

Step 2: Add Attributes to the Conversion Event

Depending on the end goal of the campaign, you can choose to narrow down the scope of conversion to a specific action like _Jimmy Choo Pumps Purchased, Episode 3 Streamed, Chapter 7 Started, MF Investment Done, Game Credits Purchased_ and so on.

This can be done by adding _attribute filters_ to the selected _Conversion Event._ Here's how you can go about it:

**Step 1:** As shown above, click on the filter icon placed next to the drop down

*   In doing so, you will be prompted by a pop-up allowing you to select an attribute and specify its value
*   For example, in the above visual, we have filtered the _event, Checkout Completed,_ by the attribute filter, _Cart Value_ which is _greater than 100 ((indicates the monetary value of the transaction, irrespective of the currency)_
    *   **This implies:** Only those users who make a purchase of more than 100 (as per the account's currency) will be counted towards the campaign's conversion metrics.

> 
> *   **Custom** _(all the custom attributes attached to the custom event selected as the conversion event)_
>     
> *   **Time** _(Event Time)_
>     
> *   **Location** _(City, Country)_
>     

**Step 2:** As shown below, click _Add Filter_ to add more attributes to the event

*   You can club multiple event attributes by the _AND/OR logic_
*   This way only those users who perform the _Conversion Event_ in the context of _All/Either_ attribute filters will be considered towards the _Conversion_ numbers of the campaign

> **AND:** Clubbing multiple event attribute filters by the _AND logic_ helps you narrow down the scope of occurrence of the _Conversion Event._ This means that only those users will be counted towards the campaign's _Conversions_ who perform the _Conversion Event_ in the context of all the event attributes.
> 
> **OR:** Clubbing multiple event attribute filter by the _OR logic_ helps you widen the scope of occurrence of the _Conversion Event._ This means that users who perform the _Conversion Event_ in the context of any of the specified event attributes\* will be counted towards the campaign's conversions.

#### 

Step 3: Set Conversion Deadline

The _Conversion Deadline_ is a duration defined by you that tells us when to stop tracking conversions for a campaign.

*   This means that once your campaign is delivered, we will track users who perform the _Conversion Event_ in the context of its attribute filters (if any), only till the specified _Conversion Deadline._

As shown above, by default, a _Conversion Deadline of 7 days_ is set for all campaigns. You can choose to specify a custom duration in _Hours or Days,_ as per the campaign's end goal.

Step 4: Enable Control Group (Optional)

A _Control Group_ is a small portion of the target audience of a campaign that is randomly selected, representing the behavior and preferences of the entire segment, and does not receive the campaign.

An optional but recommended step, adding a _Control Group_ to the target audience allows you to compare the campaign's performance against the organic behavior of _Control Group_ users. This makes for the perfect benchmark to assess the true impact of the campaign on influencing user behavior.

> Why you should (almost) always use _Control Group_ to measure the effectiveness of your campaign and how it works in your dashboard

On checking the Control Group checkbox, you are presented with another choice called 'Target Control Group', that lets you choose between two options.

*   Set a new control group for this campaign
*   Custom Control Group

**Option 1: Set a new control group for this campaign:** This will be a campaign level control group which means a control group that is created for a specific campaign only. The users in this control group are randomly added from the selected segment in 'Audience' tab. This control group is good if the aim is to measure impact for a specific campaign.

On clicking this option, the Variation Distribution slider is exposed that allows you to select percentage of users to be added in Control Group from target audience.

**Option 2: Custom Control Group:** This option is shown when at least one Custom Control Groups is created in your account. Click here for detailed read on creating custom control group.

Since this is a pre-created control group, overlapping users within this group and the target segment won't be receiving the campaigns.

Custom control groups are good for analyzing effectiveness of multiple campaigns. For example: Analyzing effectiveness of SMS and Email campaigns during Diwali sale.

Unlike Campaign level control group, the percentage of users to be part of control group cannot be controlled when Custom control group is selected.

Variation Distribution (Multivariate Testing)


-------------------------------------------------

If you have created multiple versions of the _In-app Notification_ at _Step 3: Message,_ then you can choose to automate the testing process by enabling _Send Winning Variation Automatically_. _Doing so will allow you to test all the \_Variations_(and _Control Group_ if enabled) with a smaller test audience and we will automatically send the winning variant to the entire target audience. \_(detailed read)\*

However, you can opt to test the _Variations_ and _Control Group_ manually if you are unwilling to test the campaign with a minimum of test audience of 500 messages.

Here's how each setting works:

####

> Given the highly targeted nature of _In-app campaigns,_ they are treated as _Triggered campaigns_ across your dashboard. These are ongoing cycles of communication that are sent to users only when they perform a certain action or _Event_. Thus, the most scientific way to test _Variations_ of an _In-app campaign_ is by ensuring that a significant number of messages are delivered before we draw a comparison.

**Step 1: Specify Size of Test Audience**

The _Test Audience_ can be defined only in terms of the number of messages delivered. This means that _Variation_ testing will continue until the specified number of messages have been successfully delivered.

As shown below, we have specified that a minimum of 1500 messages must be triggered to users to identify a winning version. This means that all the _Variations ( & Control Group, if enabled)_ will be equally divided amongst the specified number.

**Step 2: Select Win Criteria**

The _Win Criteria_ is a performance indicator that helps us determine a winning _Variation_ according to the campaign's end goal. As shown above, it can be defined as any of the following:

*   _Impressions_
*   _Clicks_
*   _Conversions_

Once we identify a winning _Variation_, it will be sent as the only campaign to all the subsequent users who perform the _trigger event_.

Manual Distribution

If you are unwilling to test the _In-app campaign_ with a minimum test audience of 500 messages, then you can choose to test the _Variations_ manually.

Click to enlarge

As shown above, all the _Variations_ created in _Step 3: Message_ are equally divided amongst the entire target audience. Using the slider, you can choose to specify a custom share for each _Variation_ and _Control Group,_ if enabled.

> **Quick Read:** How manual _Variation Distribution_ works

Depending on your _Variation testing settings_, the campaign will be tested against the _Control Group_ in either of the following ways:

#### 

Impact on Variation Slider if Control group is enabled

In case the **Control Groups have been enabled** the Variation Distribution slider behaves differently based on the type of control group selected:

**If Campaign level control group is selected:** In this case, the user will have the option of adding the control group by deciding the percentage or size of the control group on variation distribution slider.

**If Custom Control Group is selected:** You will not be able to manually select the size of the control group using the variation slider since the Custom Control Group is pre-created and overlapping users in the selected Custom Control Group and target segment, won't be receiving the campaign.

> 🚧
> 
> Keep in Mind
> 
> 
> ------------------
> 
> *   In a particular campaign, Custom Control Group and campaign control group cannot be applied together.
>     
> *   Universal control group can be added irrespective of Custom Control Group or Campaign Control Group is selected.
>     
> *   In case multiple control groups are applied within same campaign (E.g: Universal Control Group + Custom Control Group or Universal Control Group + Campaign control): In this case, since the users in both the control group are mutually exclusive, the overall control group size will increase and the target audience size will decrease.

Step 5: Test Campaign


=========================

Test your In-app campaigns just as your users would experience them. Previously, you could only preview the UI on the dashboard, but now you can conduct full end-to-end tests on devices.

**Steps to Test In-App Campaigns**

*   You can test the In-app from 2 places
    *   The Message step of the campaign creation
    *   The Test Campaign step of the campaign creation

*   Create a test segment based on user IDs by clicking on the ➕ icon

*   Trigger the test In-App by clicking on the Test Campaign button (Prerequisite Push permission should be granted and the user should be reachable for Push for test In-App to be rendered on the user’s device).

> 📘
> 
> Testing your Campaigns are optional
> 
> 
> -----------------------------------------
> 
> Although testing your campaign with an internal test is optional, WE do highly recommend it.

#### 

Behavior of Test In-App Notifications

*   If the app is in the foreground you’ll get the Test In-App on the app.
*   If the app is in the background or killed state, a push notification will be received. On clicking on it the app will be opened and the Test In-App will be shown.
*   If there is already an In-App shown on screen it will be dismissed and the Test In-App will be shown to the user. On dismissing the Test In-App, previous In-App will be visible again.
*   If there is already a Test In-App shown on screen, it will be dismissed and the new Test In-App will be shown to the user. On dismissing the Test In-App previous test In-App will not be visible again.
*   The Push can fail in certain scenarios and there can be a delay as well so rendering can delay after clicking on the Send Test Button.

Step 6: Preview & Launch


============================

Once you've set up the campaign it's time to start to engaging app uses! But before that, we recommend that you conduct a quick preview of the campaign's message and settings to ensure that it's in line with your end goal.

Click to enlarge

As shown above, the last step of campaign creation presents a snapshot of its:

*   Target apps and segment _(Step 1: Audience)_
*   Target screens, message frequency and trigger settings _(Step 2: When)_
*   Message _Variations_ and OS-wise preview _(Step 3: Message)_
*   _Conversion Tracking_ and multivariate test settings _(Step 4: Conversion Tracking)_

#### 

Edit Campaign Before Launch

You can always choose to edit a step by clicking on the _Edit icon,_ placed next to each step's header. In doing so, you will be directed back to the step.

Simply make your edits, save them, toggle back to _Step 6: Preview & Launch_ to continue your review, as shown above.

#### 

Saving Campaign as a Draft

If you're unsure or are awaiting approval of the campaign's contents, then you can simply go back to the _central hub of In-app_ after saving your settings, as shown below. Doing so will automatically save the campaign as a _Draft,_ allowing you to edit or launch it anytime you like.

#### 

Launching Scheduled Campaigns

If you have chosen to schedule/ start the campaign at a later date-time, then on launching it, its status will indicate _Upcoming_ in _In-app, List of Campaigns_, as shown below.

Click to enlarge

#### 

What Happens After a Campaign is Launched?

Once launched, messages are sent to users included in the target audience as per the campaign's settings. Throughout it's run time, the campaign's status will indicate _Running_ (in _In-app, List of Campaigns)_ until it ends or is manually paused by you.

**1\. Analyzing Campaign's Performance**

You can analyze each campaign's real-time impact on user engagement, conversions, and revenue by accessing its _Overview section_ through the _List of Campaigns of In-app_, as shown below.

**2\. Modifying the Campaign**

Further, you can always choose to _Edit_ or _Pause_ an _Upcoming_ or _Running)_ campaign if you feel the need to. _(Step-by-step guide on modifying In-app campaigns)_

**3\. Scheduling Campaign Reports**

Once you have launched a campaign, you easily monitor its performance through scheduled reports, delivered straight to your (& your teammate's) inbox! This can be configured through the campaign's analysis section. _Here's how you can go about it._

Further, you can also schedule Channel-wise reports to monitor the overall performance of _In-app_ through the _Settings_ section of your account. _Here's how you can go about it._

We hope this has equipped you with a robust understanding of how you can:

*   Contextually engage app users with visually stunning in-app messages.
*   Track conversions.
*   Automate multivariate testing.
