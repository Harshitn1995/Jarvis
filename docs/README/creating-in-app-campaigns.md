## 🎯 Why Use In-App Campaigns?

In-app campaigns allow you to engage users **directly inside your app**, based on real-time context. Here's why they work:

- 📍 **Precision Targeting**: Show the right message at the right moment inside the app.
- 🧠 **Personalization**: Craft contextual messages based on user behavior and data.
- ⚡ **Instant Engagement**: Drive immediate actions like purchases, signups, or feedback.
- 🔒 **Secure and Controlled**: Fully managed inside your ecosystem, without external dependencies.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Before you begin, ensure:

- Your app is **integrated with the Jarvis SDK**.
- You have at least one **live segment** to target.
- You’ve reviewed design guidelines for optimal UX.

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Guide

### **Step 1**: Navigate to `Campaigns → In-App`  
Click on the ➕ button to **create a new In-App Campaign**.

### **Step 2**: Name Your Campaign  
Give your campaign a unique and meaningful name for easy identification.

### **Step 3**: Choose the Audience  
Select a **user segment** you want to target (e.g., "Cart Abandoners", "New Users").

### **Step 4**: Select Trigger Conditions  
Decide when the message should appear:
- App Open
- After specific user events
- On screen visit

### **Step 5**: Choose Your Layout  
Pick from available layout options:

### **Step 6**: Customize the Design  
Edit your content:
- 🖋️ Title & Message
- 🎨 Colors, Fonts, Images
- 🔗 CTAs (Call-to-Action buttons)
