Engaging users with _Web Push Notifications_ is an effective way to grab their attention with offers, and drive platform engagement. Your dashboard comes with a highly intuitive 6-step campaign creation interface that makes it easy to execute highly personalized campaigns in minutes!

> At WebEngage, we are obsessed with enabling consumer business, like yours, to create contextual experiences that facilitate retention-led growth. This is why user data _(User Attributes)_, behavioral data _(Events & Event Attributes)_ and _Segments_ play an integral role in campaign creation. We recommend that you get yourself acquainted with the respective concepts before proceeding.

**Here's a quick summary of the exciting possibilities offered by the campaign creation interface:**

*   **Personalize messages** to each user's preferences and behavior, across the various stages of their lifecycle _(skip to Step 3: Message)_
    
*   **Automate multivariate message testing** for your campaign - we'll automatically identify a winner and send it to the entire audience _(skip to Step 4: Conversion Tracking & Variation Distribution)_
    
*   Leverage ready-to-use templates to **engage users with rich Web Push Notifications** _(skip to Step 3: Message, Layout)_
    
*   **Test your campaign with internal team members** before sending it to your users _(skip to Step 5: Test Campaign)_
    
*   **Avoid disturbing users during DND hours,** implemented in their timezone _(skip to Step 2: When, DND)_
    
*   **Schedule campaigns for delayed delivery** to users who are currently unavailable _(skip to Step 2: When, Queueing)_
    

Select Campaign Type


------------------------

As shown below, the campaign creation interface can be accessed by clicking the _Plus icon_ placed on the top left of the _central hub of Web Push._ In doing so, you will be prompted to select the type of campaign you'd like to create.

Click to enlarge

Let's quickly walk you through each campaign type:

#### 

One-time

These are stand-alone messages that are sent to your users only once and generally comprise of time-bound offers, festive deals, product updates and so on. Such campaigns end as soon as they're delivered to the target audience.

*   _When:_ Launch immediately or Schedule for later
*   _How Often:_ Once only

> 🚧
> --
> 
> **Skip to Step 2, When:** Campaign Schedule > Setting up One-time Campaign

#### 

Triggered

These are ongoing cycles of communication that are sent to only those users of your target audience, who perform a particular event on your app/website.

*   _When:_ Launch immediately or Schedule for later
*   _How Often:_ Whenever the specified _Event_ is performed by a user or a few _Minutes/ Hours/ Days_ after the event occurs

> 🚧
> --
> 
> **Skip to Step 2, When:** Campaign Schedule > Setting up Triggered Campaign

#### 

Recurring

These are ongoing cycles of communication that are scheduled to be sent periodically to its target audience. Such campaigns help you automate communication for several recurring events in your user's lifecycle like _subscription renewals, policy renewals, bill payments, recurring investments_ and so on.

Or you could leverage these campaigns to _engage all new users who have recently signed up, users who performed a certain action on your app but left without transacting or proceeding to the next stage_ and so on.

*   _When:_ Launch immediately or Schedule for later
*   _How Often:_ Daily, Weekly or Monthly

> 🚧
> --
> 
> **Skip to Step 2, When:** Campaign Schedule > Setting up Recurring Campaign

#### 

Transactional

These are highly contextual messages that your users expect to receive while interacting with your brand through your app, website or offline. This could be anything like _acknowledging user interactions like, sign up (welcome newsletter), password reset, payment confirmation (invoice), order confirmation or conveying payment reminders, account statements_ and so on.

*   _When:_ Launch immediately
*   _How Often:_ Whenever a specific _Event_ occurs in your backend

Now, let's walk you through all the steps of campaign creation.

Step 1: Define the Audience


-------------------------------

### 

1: Name your Campaign

The first step is to give your campaign a unique name that helps you identify its purpose.

### 

2\. Select Audience type

One of the key differentiators of a successful campaign is that they're tailored to the behavior and preferences of a specific group of users. Thus, by selecting an _Audience Type,_ you can choose to target a particular segment of users or combine several segments to define your _Email campaign's_ audience.

**As shown below:**

Click to enlarge

*   Select **Send to users in single segment** to target all users who are included within a particular segment _(How to set it up)_
    
*   Select **Send to users in multiple segments and/or don't send to users in certain segments** to narrow down the audience to a very specific user persona, defined by including and excluding several segments from the target audience _(How to set up the conditions - Send To & Don't Send To)_
    

### 

3\. Select Target Segment(s)

Here's how you can set up each _Audience Type:_

#### 

3A. Select a Segment (Send To)

_(If **Send to users in single segment** is selected as Audience Type)_

As shown below, click the dropdown nested beside _Send To,_ to specify the target segment.

Click to enlarge

On selecting a segment, you will be able to preview a snapshot of _Reachable Users_ and the _Rules of Segmentation._ Let's quickly walk you through **Segment Preview**:

*   **Reachable Users:** Indicates the number of users, from the selected segment, that can be engaged through _Web Push_ as a channel, at present.
    
*   **Rules of Segmentation:** You can choose to segment your entire user base by 3 broad parameters - User (attributes), Behavior and Technology. Thus, _Segment Preview_ presents a snapshot of all parameters, based on which the users have been grouped together.

> How to Create a Disposable Segment
> 
> **Step 2: When**

#### 

3B. Combine Segments (Send To)

_(If **Send to users in multiple segments and/or don't send to users in certain segments** is selected as Audience Type)_

Using multiple segments to define the target audience is an excellent way to target users that have similar preferences, belong to the same location or have performed certain actions on your website - without creating a new segment.

Here's how you can go about it:

Click to enlarge

**Step 1: Select a Condition**

*   _Select **Users in ANY of these segments** to send the campaign to all the users included within each segment._
    
*   \*Select **Users in ALL of these segments** to send the campaign only those users who are shared by all the segments.
    

**Step 2: Select a Segment**

**Step 3: Click Add Segment** to specify another one.

> 
> **Step 2: When**

#### 

3C. Exclude Segments (Send To)

_(If **Send to users in multiple segments and/or don't send to users in certain segments** is selected as Audience Type)_

You can choose to exclude a segment or multiple segments from the target audience by configuring the field, _Don't Send To._ This is a great way to selectively engage users that match a specific persona. Here's how you can go about it:

Click to enlarge

**Step 1: Select a Condition**

*   _Select **Users in ANY of these segments** to prevent users in each segment from receiving the campaign._
    
*   _Select **Users in ALL of these segments** to prevent only those users from receiving the campaign that are common between all the segments._
    

**Step 2: Select a Segment**

**Step 3: Click Add Segment** to select another one.

> 🚧
> 
> When Segment Isn't Specified Under the field, 'Send To'
> 
> 
> -------------------------------------------------------------
> 
> By default, a campaign is set to be delivered to _All Users._ Thus, if no segment is selected under _Send To_ AND segments are specified under _Don't Send To,_ then _the campaign will be send to all the users who are reachable on Web Push AND are not included within the specified segments._

#### 

Edit Segment

Click the _Edit icon,_ placed next to the dropdown, _Send To,_ to edit the selected _Segment._ In doing so, you will be prompted by a pop-up, pre-populated with the existing rules of segmentation, as shown below.

Click to enlarge

Simply make your edits and click _Save_ to proceed. In doing so, you will able to preview the number of reachable users as per your edits.

#### 

Create a New Segment

You can choose to create a new _Segment \_of users from the campaign creation interface by clicking on the \_Create Segment button._ In doing so, you will be prompted by a pop-up, allowing you to build a new segment, as shown below.

Click to enlarge

Once created, you will be able to access the _Segment_ through the _List of Segments_ in your dashboard.

#### 

Creating a New, Single-use Segment

You can also choose to create disposable segments or segment users specifically for the campaign and avoid adding it to the _List of Segments_ in your dashboard.

This can be achieved by leaving the field, _Name_ blank while creating the segment. In doing so, it will become an _Ad hoc segment_ in your dashboard which will be available only for sending the campaign you're currently creating.

> Related Read: Rules of Segmentation

> -----------------------------------------
> 
> Please refer to _Creating Segments_ for step-by-step guidance on how you can segment your users by their attributes, behavior (events), and technological preferences.

#### 

Apply Universal Control Group

> 
> ------------------------
> 
> This is a conditional option which will be shown only if the you have created Universal control group in your account. Click here to know how to create Universal control group.

click to enlarge

*   **When the box is checked**, the campaign will not be sent to users who are part of the Universal Control Group in the segment that is selected.
*   **When the box is unchecked**, the campaign will be sent to all users that are part of the segment inclusive of the Universal Control Group users.

Step 2: Specify When to Send


--------------------------------

Click to enlarge

As highlighted above, the second step of campaign creation allows you to specify when and how often you'd like the _target audience_ to receive the _Web Push Notification_ and manage the role your campaign plays in your overall engagement strategy. Hence, _When_ has been divided into two sections:

*   Campaign Schedule
*   Frequency Capping & DND

Let's get you acquainted with the workings of each:

### 

Campaign Schedule

Here you can specify **when and how often** the target audience should receive the campaign. This can be determined by configuring the Campaign Type selected when you initiated creation. Here's how you can go about it:

> 🚧
> 
> Navigate to:
> 
> 
> ------------------
> 
> One-time Campaign
> 
> Triggered Campaign
> 
> Recurring Campaign

#### 

Setting up One-time Campaign

**Step 1:** As shown below, select _One-time_ as the _Campaign Type_

Click to enlarge

**Step 2:** Specify the _Delivery Time_

As shown above:

*   _Select **Now** to send the campaign immediately_
*   _Select **Later** to schedule the campaign:_  
    You can choose from the 2 options i.e. _Send Intelligently_ or to send at a specific time.
    *   **Send Intelligently**: optimizes campaign send-time for each user, our system intelligently decides the best time to send a campaign based on your user’s interactions with past campaigns of each channel. Click here to know more.
    *   **Send at Specific Time**: You can specify the time at which you would like to send your campaign to your users, either from the _users time zone_ or the campaign's _project time zone_.  
        You can choose to schedule a _one-time Push campaign_ for delivery in your user's timezone! _(How it works)_

> 🚧
> --
> 
> **Skip to** _Frequency Capping & DND_ to complete _Step 2: When_, of the campaign creation process.

#### 

Setting up Triggered Campaign

**Step 1:** As shown below, select _Triggered_ as the _Campaign Type_

Click to enlarge

**Step 2:** As shown above, select _the Event upon the occurrence of which the campaign will be triggered or sent to the user_

*   For example, in the above visual we have selected the custom event _Product - Added to Cart_ as the trigger event

> 📘
> 
> The following options can be selected here:
> 
> 
> -------------------------------------------------
> 
> *   **Custom** _(all the custom events being tracked for your account)_
>     
> *   **System** _(all the campaign events pre-defined by us for tracking user-channel interactions like app installed, push delivered, push opened and so on.)_
>     

**Step 3 (Optional):** _Add Attribute Filters to the Event_ by clicking on the filter icon.

> 📘
> 
> The following options can be selected here:
> 
> 
> -------------------------------------------------
> 
> *   **Custom** (all the custom attributes attached to the custom event selected as the trigger event)
>     
> *   **Time** _(Event Time)_
>     
> *   **Location** _(City, Country)_
>     
> *   **Technology** (Device Manufacturer, Device Model, Carrier, App Version, App ID, SDK Version)
>     
> *   **Engagement** _(Campaign ID, Journey ID - can be found under the campaign's overview & journey's overview)_
>     
>     *   These attributes are applicable only to _campaign events_ like _Email Rejected, Push, Dismissed_ and so on.
> *   **Others** _(Session Count, Language)_
>     

*   Further, you can choose to club multiple event attributes by the _AND/OR logic_ to define the scope of occurrence of the event.
    
*   Doing so implies that if users included within the target segment don't perform the specified _Event,_ in the context of the added attribute filter(s), then they will not receive the campaign.
    

> 🚧
> 
> How It Works: Clubbing Event Attributes by AND/OR Logic
> 
> 
> -------------------------------------------------------------
> 
> **AND:** _Implies that users will have to perform the Event in the context of all the event attributes to receive the campaign._ (Helps you narrow down the target audience)
> 
> **OR:** _Implies that users will receive the campaign if they perform the Event in the context of either_ event attribute.\* (Helps you widen the target audience)

**Step 4:** Specify the _Delivery Time_ of the triggered campaign

Click to enlarge

As shown in the above:

*   _Select **Send as soon as the event occurs** to delivery the campaign immediately_
*   _Select **Wait for (duration) and then send** to deliver the campaign after sometime_
*   You can set up a wait time in _Minutes, Hours or Weeks_, after which, the campaign will be sent to the respective users

**Step 5:** Specify the _Start Date_ or the date-time on which the triggered campaign should start getting delivered to the target audience

As highlighted in the visual below:

*   _Select **Now** to send the campaign immediately_
*   _Select **Later** to schedule the campaign_

Click to enlarge

**Step 6:** Specify the _End Date_ or the date-time on which the triggered campaign should cease getting delivered to the target audience

As highlighted in the visual above:

*   _Select **Never** to run the campaign indefinitely_ (you can always choose to _Pause_ a campaign manually through its _Campaign Overview_)
*   _Select **Later** to stop the campaign at a specific date-time in the near future_

> 🚧
> --
> 
> **Skip to** the second section, _Frequency Capping & DND_ to complete _Step 2: When_, of the campaign creation process.

#### 

Setting up Recurring Campaign

**Step 1:** As shown below, select _Recurring_ as the _Campaign Type_

Click to enlarge

**Step 2:** Specify the _Delivery Schedule_ or the frequency and date-time of campaign delivery.

As shown in the visual above, the frequency of a recurring campaign can be set as:

*   _Daily,_ at a specific _Time_
*   _Weekly,_ at a specific _Day and Time_
*   _Monthly,_ on a specific _Day of the Month and Time_

**Step 3:** Specify the _Start Date_ or the date-time on which the recurring campaign should start getting delivered to the target audience.

As highlighted in the visual below:

*   _Select **Now** to send the campaign immediately_
*   _Select **Later** to schedule the campaign_

**View Realised Schedule** shows you the entire schedule for your campaign as set by you.

**Step 4:** Specify the _End Date_ or the date-time on which the campaign should cease getting delivered to the target audience

As highlighted in the visual above:

*   _Select **Never** to run the campaign indefinitely_ (you can always choose to _Pause_ a campaign manually through its _Campaign Overview_)
*   _Select **Later** to stop the campaign at a specific date-time in the near future_

### 

Frequency Capping, DND, Queuing & Throttling

Here you can leverage the features of _Frequency Capping (FC), DND Hours, Queueing_ and _Throttling_ to determine how a user perceives your _Push campaign_ in the context of your entire engagement experience.

**Context:** Campaigns don't exist in isolation. Most marketing campaigns are designed for a specific audience, motivating them to perform a particular action. And more often than not, users receive multiple campaigns through various channels, nudging them towards a similar goal.

**Thus, these features allow you to manage the frequency and timing of campaign delivery for each user.** Let's get you acquainted with the workings of each:

#### 

FC

Using _Frequency Capping (FC),_ you can control the number of campaigns a user receives within a _Day, Week, Month_ and maintain a consistent gap between consecutive messages (sent through multiple channels or the same channel).

Click to enlarge

As highlighted above:

*   _Select **Follow...** to send the campaign as per your account's frequency capping and time gap settings_
    
    *   This means that if the upper limit on the number of messages a user can receive within a day, week or month is exhausted, then this campaign will get queued for delayed delivery _(detailed read on how this works)_
*   _Select **Ignore...** to ensure campaign delivery even if the frequency cap for the day/week/month has been met for a user (impact of disabling FC for a campaign)_
    

**Set Frequency Capping Limits**

If you have not set up _Frequency Capping_ yet, then you can choose to configure it by clicking the _Set Frequency Capping Limits button_. As shown above, in doing so you will be directed to your account's settings, in a new tab. _(How to configure FC & Time Gap)_

*   Once set, you will be able to send all your campaigns with FC enabled, including the existing one.
*   **Pro Tip:** _Toggle back to the campaign creation tab and refresh to enable FC._

#### 

DND

Using the _DND Settings_ of your account, you can prevent users from receiving campaigns during specific periods such as when they may be asleep, and so on. The best part - _DND hours_ are determined individually for each user. This means that _the duration specified by you will be applied to all your users only in the context of their time zone!_

Click to enlarge

As highlighted above:

*   _Select **Follow...** to ensure that users aren't disturbed by the Push Notifications at the hours specified by you (as per their timezone)_
*   _Select **Ignore...** to ensure campaign delivery even if \_DND hours_ are applicable to a few users (Disabling DND for a campaign)\_

**Set DND Hours**

If you haven't set up _DND Hours_ yet, then you can choose to configure it by clicking the _Set DND Hours button._ As shown above, in doing so you will be directed to your account's settings, in a new tab. _(How to configure DND Hours)_

*   Once set, you will be able to send all your campaigns with _DND hours_ enabled, including the existing one.
*   **Pro Tip:** _Toggle back to the campaign creation tab and refresh to enable DND._

#### 

Queueing

If you choose to send a campaign with _FC_ or _DND_ enabled, then _Queueing_ is automatically enabled. It's a feature that allows delayed delivery of the message to a user, in cases where immediate delivery is not possible due to your _FC_ or _DND settings._

Click to enlarge

As highlighted above:

*   _Select **Queue message for up to...**, to enable the feature and specify a custom queueing duration for the campaign in Minutes, Hours or Days_.
    *   Doing so will ensure that we hold on to the campaign for the specified duration and send it only when a combination of your _FC_ and _DND settings_ allow us to. _(How delivery time is determined for queued messages)_
*   _Select **Do not Queue messages...** to drop the message if we're unable to deliver it to a user due to FC/DND settings (Disabling Queueing for a campaign)_

#### 

Throttling

Click to enlarge

As highlighted above:

*   _Select **Do not throttle campaign...** to send all messages instantly to the entire target audience._
    
*   _Select **Throttle campaigns as per channel throttling limits** to control the number of messages delivered per minute._
    
*   _Select **Throttle campaigns at...** to specify a custom message throttling duration for this campaign._
    
    *   Please note, this limit cannot be higher than the channel-level throttling limit specified under _Settings > Throttling._

Step 3: Create the Message


------------------------------

Click to enlarge

As highlighted above, the message creation interface comes loaded with intuitive features like _Variations, Layouts, Personalized Button Links and Message Preview_ - enabling you to create high impact _Web Push Notifications_ in minutes.

Let's get you acquainted with each feature:

### 

Select a Layout

You can choose from the following ready-to-use templates to create a _Variation._

Click to enlarge

**Text:** A text-only template, allows you to send quick updates and offers, personalized to each user's preferences and behavioral history. _(Creating dynamic text notifications)_

Personalising Text Web Push Notifications

**Banner:** A single-fold media template that allows you create visually personalized notifications. _(Creating personalized banner notifications)_

Personalising Banner Web Push Notifications

You can always choose to change the template of a _Variation_ by clicking the _Edit icon,_ allowing you to start building the message from scratch.

### 

Basic (Message)

As you may be aware, the way your users experience a _Web Push Notification_ depends heavily on the _Browser_ and _OS_ they're using. For example, _Chrome & Firefox_ browsers in _Mac devices_ don't support banner images. The color scheme of your notification may appear drastically different in _Windows 10_ devices compared to lower versions. While the button placement will differ for mobile and desktop devices.

This is why we have made it extremely easy for you to preview the layout for all the popular _Browser-OS_ combinations and have the limitations of each element alongside the steps listed below.

#### 

Step 1: Create a Dynamic Text Template

_(Number of characters shown in the notification may differ as per the OS & Browser)_

Using the _Personalization icon_ nested under each field, you can easily create dynamically personalized content. Simply select a value from a list of all the _Custom User attributes_ and _Custom Events_ being tracked for your account and place them appropriately within the message. We'll add the exact value tracked for each user, helping you deliver one-on-one messages at scale :)

#### 

Step 2: Add Custom Icon

Support by all _Browser-OS_ combinations, adding an icon to your notification is one of the best ways to ensure that users instantly recognize your brand, helping you drive better engagement & conversion rates. This is why we recommend that you personalize the icon to each user for maximum impact!

Click to enlarge

As shown above, a generic icon can be added in two ways:

**1\. Insert Image Link:** The image must be hosted on a crawlable/publicly accessible domain to ensure that it renders for all users receiving the message.

**2\. Upload Image:** Click the _Upload_ button and select a file from your desktop. In doing so, the image will get hosted on WebEngage's domain: _https://afiles.webengage.com_.

You can always click the _Reset_ button to link/upload a new icon.

>     

#### 

Step 3: Add On-click Action Link

Add a link to the web page you'd like to direct users to when they click anywhere on the notification, barring the buttons. We recommend that you personalize the link to each user for maximum impact!

Click to enlarge

For example, in the visual above, we have personalized the link to the page viewed by a user by adding the _Custom Event, Product Page Viewed_ and its _Custom Attribute, page\_url_ to the field.

### 

Configure Banner Image

_(Applicable only to Chrome v56 & above on Windows, Android and Microsoft Edge v17 & above)_

If you have selected _Banner_ as the layout for a _Variation,_ then using this section, you will be able to add the image and even personalize it to each user's preferences/behavior.

Click to enlarge

As shown above, a generic banner image can be added in two ways:

**1\. Insert Image Link:** The image must be hosted on a crawlable/publicly accessible domain to ensure that it renders for all users receiving the message.

**2\. Upload Image:** Click the _Upload_ button placed next to the field, image and select a file from your desktop. In doing so, the image will get hosted on WebEngage's domain: _https://afiles.webengage.com_.

You can always click the _Reset_ button to link/upload a new image.

### 

Configure Buttons

_(Applicable only to Chrome v48 & above on Windows, Android and Microsoft Edge v17 & above)_

As shown below, click the toggle button to enable and add up to 2 buttons to your notification.

Click to enlarge

Here's how you can configure each button:

#### 

Step 1: Add Label (CTA)

_Label_ refers to the button's text or call-to-action. You can specify a generic label for each button or personalize it to an action performed by your users, creating a highly contextual experience!

> 👍
> 
> Fact Check
> 
> 
> ----------------
> 
> The _Label_ and _On-click Action link_ must be in sync to deliver a consolidated _Web Push_ experience

#### 

Step 2: Insert Link (On-click Action)

As highlighted above, add a link to the web page you'd like to direct users to when they click on the button. We recommend that you personalize each link to your users for maximum impact!

### 

Advanced Options

#### 

1\. Disable Auto-Hide Notification

_(Applicable only to Chrome v47 & above on Windows)_

Most browsers auto-hide the _Web Push Notification_ after a few seconds of inactivity. While this is a great way to create a non-intrusive browsing experience, you can always choose to disable it. Doing so will keep the notification visible until a user clicks on it or dismisses it.

*   Both actions are tracked as the campaign events, _Notification Clicked_ and _Notification Dismissed,_ respectively.

Click to enlarge

As shown above, click the toggle button to enable _Advanced Options_ and click the checkbox to disable auto-hide.

#### 

2\. Add Custom Badge

_(Applicable only to Android v6+ users on Chrome v56+)_

If you're targeting a large number of _Android_ users, then you can easily choose to replace the Chrome badge with a custom badge that resonates with your brand. This is a great way to subtly enforce brand recall for your users while engaging them within tailored communication.

Click to enlarge

As shown above:

**Step 1:** Select _Custom_ against _Badge_ to upload your own.

**Step 2:** Add a link to the badge or upload the image file to the dashboard under the field, _Badge._ Please adhere to the following guidelines while doing so:

*   The badge must be monochrome as RGB colors are not supported by the OS-browser.
*   We recommend a _width:height ratio of 1:1_ with the _ideal image size being 72px by 72px._
*   Please upload the image in _.png, .gif, .webp, .ico, .cur, .bmp_ formats only, in a file size not exceeding _1MB._
*   If you're adding a link, then please ensure that the image is hosted on an https domain.

You can visualize the _Badge's_ appearance through the _Preview section_ by selecting _Chrome Android._

#### 

UTM Parameters

*   Start by enabling UTM at the global level through the Configurations section on the dashboard. This ensures that campaign-level UTM tagging is enabled by default. Click here to know how.
*   **Modify or Edit UTM at Campaign Level**: While global UTM is setup, you can modify parameters for specific campaigns as well as per you needs.
*   **Disabling Global UTM**: While disabling the UTM setup at global level you can choose whether to keep UTM for already running campaigns or remove it from all campaigns.

**Note**: Campaigns which are already sent with UTM parameters cannot be removed.

### 

Preview Notification

Depending on the OS and browser through which your users have opted-in, certain elements of the message may appear differently, or may not appear at all.

Click to enlarge

As shown above, you can preview the notification's appearance through the left half of the campaign creation interface. You can toggle between multiple _Browser-OS combinations_ to view the message **as it is (raw preview)** or **as per a specific user's data (user preview).**

> 📘
> 
> Notification's appearance can be visualized for the following browser & OS combinations:
> 
> 
> ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>     
> *   Chrome Android
>     
> *   Firefox Windows
>     
> *   Firefox Mac
>     

#### 

Raw Preview

As the name suggests, it renders the _Web Push Notification_ with the raw text and attributes, as added by you to the _Title & Message._

Click to enlarge

#### 

User Preview

Allows you to view the _Notification_ for an actual user from your account by populating it with data from their user profile, as per the elements of personalization added to _Title & Message._

Click to enlarge

For example, in the visual above, we have visualized the _Web Push Notification_ for the _User ID, benjamind\_3674._ Here's how you can go about it:

**Step 1:** Select _User Preview_ from the dropdown placed on the top left

*   In doing so, you will be prompted by a pop-up allowing you to search for a user to populate the corresponding attribute and event values.

**Step 2:** Enter the _User ID,_ preferably of a power user included within the target audience

*   Access _List of Users_ of the campaign's target Segment (as specified at _Step 1: Audience)_ to identify an ideal user

**Step 3:** Click the _Search and Populate_ button

*   In doing so, you will be shown a summary of the values against the respective attributes and events included in the message. This is a good way to ensure that all the values are available for the user, if not then you can enter an alternate _User ID._

**Step 4:** Click the _See Preview_ button on the pop-up to visualize the notification with real user data

*   While this is a great way to gauge the overall look and feel of the _Push Notification,_ we recommend that you test the campaign with an internal test segment to ensure that it's good to go!

### 

Create Variations

_Variations_ are just different versions of the campaign's message that facilitate easy multivariate testing and are referred to in the following manner in your dashboard:  
**Variation A:** The first version of the message.  
**Variation B:** The second version of the message.  
**Variation C, D, E:** Subsequent versions of the message created for testing.

Click to enlarge

As shown above, by default the message creation interface consists of a single _Variation A._

*   You can click on the _Plus icon_ to create up to 5 versions of the message.
    
    *   _Select **Create New** to start building the new Variation from scratch_
    *   _Select **Copy from Variation A** (or any of the previous versions) to make minor edits to the new Variation_
*   Each _Variation_ can be created independent of the other, allowing you to test multiple aspects like its layout, body copy, buttons, and links to identify a mix that resonates with your entire target audience. _(How to test message Variations)_
    
*   The percentage values indicate the share of users, that will receive a _Variation_ and can be customized at _Step 4: Conversion Tracking._
    

#### 

Test Message

You can easily test the message with an internal segment of users before sending it to your entire user base. As shown below, click the _Test Message_ button to _select a Variation_ and _Test Segment_. Please refer to this Step-by-step Guide to proceed.

Step 4: Set up Conversion Tracking & Variation Testing


----------------------------------------------------------

The fourth step of campaign creation allows you to measure the effectiveness of your campaign in various ways like:

*   _Tracking conversions for a specific goal_
*   _Comparing performance against a control group_
*   _Testing multiple variations of the message to identify a winning version_

Hence, it has been divided into two sections: **Conversion Tracking** and **Variation Distribution.** However, depending on the number of message _Variations_ created by you, the view of _Step 4: Conversion Tracking_ varies:

#### 

When only 1 Variation Exists

As shown below, on proceeding from _Step 3: Message,_ you will be welcomed by an interface where _Conversion Tracking_ is disabled.

*   Click the toggle switch to configure _Conversion Tracking._  
    OR
*   Proceed to _Step 5: Test Campaign_ if you don't expect users perform an action after receiving the message.

Click to enlarge

#### 

When Multiple Variations Exist

As shown below, on proceeding from _Step 3: Message,_ you will be welcomed by an interface on which:

*   _Conversion Tracking_ is disabled.
*   _Variation Distribution_ meter indicates the share of the audience that will receive each _Variation._

Click to enlarge

Let's get you acquainted with the workings of _Step 4: Conversion Tracking:_

### 

Conversion Tracking

> 🚧
> 
> Must Read
> 
> 
> ---------------
> 
> We recommend that you gain a broad understanding of how _Conversion Tracking_ works in your dashboard before proceeding. Doing so will lay a strong foundation for understanding whether or not you need to enable _Conversion Tracking_ for the campaign and its impact on _Revenue Tracking_.

By default, _Conversion Tracking_ is disabled for all _Push campaigns._ As shown below, you can use the toggle switch to enable it.

#### 

Step 1: Select a Conversion Event

The term, _Conversion Event_ is an alias that helps you identify the event you expect users to perform after receiving the _Web Push Notification._

Click to enlarge

As shown above, you can choose from a list of all the _Custom Events_ being tracked for your account to specify the campaign's conversion goal.

> 📘
> 
> The following options can be selected here:
> 
> 
> -------------------------------------------------
> 
> *   **Custom** _(all the custom events being tracked for your account)_
>     
> *   **System** _(Session Started, User Login)_
>     

> 👍
> 
> Pro Tip
> 
> 
> -------------
> 
> We recommend that you map all the _Custom Events_, that record the occurrence of a monetary transaction in your app, as _Revenue Events_ in your dashboard. This will help ensure that selecting the respective events as the _Conversion Event_ of a campaign helps you track _Conversions_ and _Revenue_ for the campaign and its channel :)

#### 

Step 2: Add Attributes to the Conversion Event

Depending on the end goal of the campaign, you can choose to narrow down the scope of conversion to a specific action like _Puma Leggings Purchased, Jimmy Choo Pumps Purchased, Episode 3 Streamed, Chapter 7 Started_ and so on.

This can be done by adding _attribute filters_ to the selected _Conversion Event._ Here's how you can go about it:

Click to enlarge

**Step 1:** As shown above, click on the filter icon placed next to the drop-down

*   In doing so, you will be prompted by a pop-up allowing you to select an attribute and specify its value.

> 📘
> 
> The following options can be selected here:
> 
> 
> -------------------------------------------------
> 
> *   **Custom** _(all the custom attributes attached to the custom event selected as the conversion event)_
>     
> *   **Time** _(Event Time)_
>     
> *   **Location** _(City, Country)_
>     

**Step 2:** As shown below, click _Add Filter_ to add more attributes to the event

*   You can club multiple event attributes by the _AND/OR logic_
*   This way only those users who perform the _Conversion Event_ in the context of _All/Either_ attribute filters will be considered towards the _Conversion_ numbers of the campaign.

> 🚧
> 
> How It Works: Clubbing Event Attributes by AND/OR Logic
> 
> 
> -------------------------------------------------------------
> 
> **AND:** Clubbing multiple event attribute filters by the _AND logic_ helps you narrow down the scope of occurrence of the _Conversion Event._ This means that only those users will be counted towards the campaign's _Conversions_ who perform the _Conversion Event_ in the context of all the event attributes.
> 
> **OR:** Clubbing multiple event attribute filters by the _OR logic_ helps you widen the scope of occurrence of the _Conversion Event._ This means that users who perform the _Conversion Event_ in the context of any of the specified event attributes\* will be counted towards the campaign's conversions.

#### 

Step 3: Set Conversion Deadline

The _Conversion Deadline_ is a duration defined by you that tells us when to stop tracking conversions for a campaign.

*   This means that once your campaign is delivered, we will track users who perform the _Conversion Event_ in the context of its attribute filters (if any), only till the specified _Conversion Deadline._

Click to enlarge

As shown above, by default, a _Conversion Deadline of 7 days_ is set for all campaigns. You can choose to specify a custom duration in _Hours or Days,_ as per the campaign's end goal.

#### 

Step 4: Enable Control Group (Optional)

A _Control Group_ is a small portion of the target audience of a campaign that is randomly selected, representing the behavior and preferences of the entire segment, and does not receive the campaign.

An optional but recommended step, adding a _Control Group_ to the target audience allows you to compare the campaign's performance against the organic behavior of _Control Group_ users. This makes for the perfect benchmark to assess the true impact of the campaign on influencing user behavior.

> 🚧
> 
> Must Read
> 
> 
> ---------------
> 
> Why you should (almost) always use _Control Group_ to measure the effectiveness of your campaign and how it works in your dashboard

On checking the Control Group checkbox, you are presented with another choice called 'Target Control Group', that lets you choose between two options.

*   Set a new control group for this campaign
*   Custom Control Group

**Option 1: Set a new control group for this campaign:** This will be a campaign level control group which means a control group that is created for a specific campaign only. The users in this control group are randomly added from the selected segment in 'Audience' tab. This control group is good if the aim is to measure impact for a specific campaign.

On clicking this option, the Variation Distribution slider is exposed that allows you to select percentage of users to be added in Control Group from target audience.

**Option 2: Custom Control Group:** This option is shown when atleast one Custom Control Groups is created in your account. Click here for detailed read on creating custom control group.

Since this is a pre-created control group, overlapping users within this group and the target segment won't be receiving the campaigns.

Custom control groups are good for analyzing effectiveness of multiple campaigns. For example: Analyzing effectiveness of SMS and Email campaigns during Diwali sale.

Unlike Campaign level control group, the percentage of users to be part of control group cannot be controlled when Custom control group is selected.

### 

Variation Distribution (Multivariate Testing)

If you have created multiple versions of the _Push Notification_ at _Step 3: Message,_ then you can choose to automate the testing process by enabling _Send Winning Variation Automatically_. Doing so will allow you to test all the _Variations_(and _Control Group_ if enabled) with a smaller test audience and we will automatically send the winning variant to the entire target audience. _(detailed read)_

However, you can opt to test the _Variations_ and _Control Group_ manually if you are unable to automate testing due to the small size of the target audience (less than 2,000 users) of a _One-time_ or _Recurring campaign._ Or if you are unwilling to test a _Triggered campaign_ by sending a minimum of 500 messages.

####

>     

Depending on the campaign type selected at Step 2: When, the steps of setting up automated variation testing will vary.

#### 

Testing a One-time Campaign

Given the short lifespan of _one-time campaigns_, we suggest that you launch the campaign well in advance for testing, and schedule it for delivery at the most viable time slot (as suggested by the channel's engagement trends). Doing so will ensure that your users receive the most effective version of your campaign at a time that records the highest engagement rate.

Click to enlarge

**Step 1: Specify Size of Test Audience**  
You can choose to test the _Variations_ and _Control Group_ (if added) with **5% to 25%** of the campaign's entire target audience. As shown above, we have chosen to treat 15% of all users as the _Test Audience._

**Step 2: Define Time to Test**

A custom _test duration_ can be specified in _Minutes_ or _Hours._ As shown above, we have specified a test duration of _8 Hours._ This means that the impact of all the message _Variations_ and organic behavior of the _Control Group_ (if added) will be tracked for _8 Hours,_ after which we will determine a winner.

**Step 3: Select Win Criteria**

The _Win Criteria_ is a performance indicator that helps us determine a winning _Variation_ according to the campaign's end goal. As shown above, it can be defined as _Clicks_ or _Conversions,_ as per your needs.

> **Quick Read:** _How automated variation testing works for one-time campaigns_

#### 

Testing a Triggered Campaign

_Triggered campaigns_ are on-going cycles of communication that are sent to users only when they perform a certain action or _Event_. Thus, the most scientific way to test _Variations_ of a triggered campaign is by ensuring that a significant number of messages are delivered before we draw a comparison.

**Step 1: Specify Size of Test Audience**

The _Test Audience_ can be defined only in terms of the number of messages delivered. This means that _Variation_ testing will continue until the specified number of messages have been successfully delivered.

As shown below, we have specified that a minimum of 1500 messages must be triggered to users to identify a winning version. This means that all the _Variations_ will be equally divided amongst the specified number.

Click to enlarge

**Step 2: Select Win Criteria**

The _Win Criteria_ is a performance indicator that helps us determine a winning _Variation_ according to the campaign's end goal. As shown above, it can be defined as _Clicks_ or _Conversions,_ as per your needs.

*   Once we identify a winning _Variation_, it will be sent as the only campaign to all the subsequent users who perform the _trigger event_.

> 🚧
> --
> 
> **Quick Read:** _How automated variation testing works for triggered campaigns_

#### 

Testing a Recurring Campaign

If you choose to create a _Recurring campaign_ at Step 2: When, then the entire first run of the campaign will be considered as its _Test Audience_ by default.

*   We will calculate the test results 1 hour before the second run of the campaign to identify a winning variation.
*   A winning _Variation_ will be determined as per the _Win Criteria_ and will be sent as the only campaign to all users from the second run. onwards.

Thus, as shown below, just need to define the _Win Criteria_ as _Clicks_ or _Conversions_ and we will take care of the rest.

#### 

Manual Distribution

If you are unable to set up _Send Winning Variation Automatically_ due to the small size of the target audience (less than 2,000 users) of a _One-time_ or _Recurring campaign,_ or if you are unwilling to test a _Triggered campaign_ with a minimum of 500 messages, then you can choose to test the _Variations_ manually.

Click to enlarge

> 🚧
> --
> 
> **Quick Read:** How manual _Variation Distribution_ works

Depending on your _Variation testing settings_, the campaign will be tested against the _Control Group_ in either of the following ways:

#### 

Impact on Variation Slider if Control group is enabled

In case the **Control Groups have been enabled** the Variation Distribution slider behaves differently based on the type of control group selected:

**If Campaign level control group is selected:** In this case, the user will have the option of adding the control group by deciding the percentage or size of the control group on variation distribution slider.

**If Custom Control Group is selected:** You will not be able to manually select the size of the control group using the variation slider since the Custom Control Group is pre-created and overlapping users in the selected Custom Control Group and target segment, won't be receiving the campaign.

> 🚧
> 
> Keep in mind
> 
> 
> ------------------
> 
> *   In a particular campaign, Custom Control Group and campaign control group cannot be applied together.
>     
> *   Universal control group can be added irrespective of Custom Control Group or Campaign Control Group is selected.
>     
> *   In case multiple control groups are applied within same campaign (E.g: Universal Control Group + Custom Control Group or Universal Control Group + Campaign control): In this case, since the users in both the control group are mutually exclusive, the overall control group size will increase and the target audience size will decrease.

Step 5: Test Your Campaign (Recommended)


--------------------------------------------

Iron out all the creases in your _Push Notification_ by testing it with internal team members for maximum impact!

While this is an optional step, we recommend that you test all campaigns that contain images, buttons, deep links, and elements of personalization in the message to ensure that everything's in order. This can be easily done by creating a _Test Segment_ and adding all the stakeholders to it.

However, you can always choose to skip it by clicking the _Skip Test & Proceed_ button, as highlighted above. Doing so will take you to the final step of campaign creation - _Step 6: Preview & Launch._

Now, let's show you how you can test all the message _Variations_:

#### 

Step 5.1.: Select a Variation

Click to enlarge

As shown above, by default, _Variation A_ is selected against the field - _Variation To Test._

However, if you have created multiple _Variations_ then you can test each one by sending them consecutively to a _Test Segment._

#### 

Step 5.2.: Select Test Segment

Click to enlarge

As shown above, all the test segments created while testing a campaign, for any channel _(Push, SMS, Web Push, Email, WhatsApp),_ can be found under the dropdown, _Send Test Message To,_ along with details of all its users.

#### 

Step 5.3.: Personalize Test Message

Click to enlarge

As highlighted above, you can test personalization in two ways:

*   **Use own data of users included in the test segment** to receive a message personalized to your user profile
*   **Use data of a specific user** to receive the exact message that the selected user would receive
    *   On selecting this option, you will be prompted to search for a user in your database.
    *   We recommend selecting this option if you have personalized the message to a very specific set of custom events or user attributes that are unlikely to be available for an internal team member.

Here's how you can personalize the message to a specific user:

Click to enlarge

**Step 1:** Click the _Search User_ button

*   In doing so, you will be prompted by a pop-up allowing you to search your user base

**Step 2:** Add the _User ID,_ preferably of a power user included within the target audience

*   Access _List of Users_ of the campaign's target _Segment_ (as specified at _Step 1: Audience)_ to identify an ideal user

**Step 3:** Click the _Search and Populate Values button_

*   In doing so, you will be shown a summary of the values against the respective attributes and events included in the message. This is a good way to ensure that all the values are available for the user. If not, then you can enter an alternate _User ID_ to personalize the message.
*   Next, click the _Save and Return to Test Campaign_ button to proceed with the selected user

**Step 4:** Click the _Send Test & Proceed button_ to test the campaign!
