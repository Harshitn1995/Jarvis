## 💡 Why Web Push?

Web push notifications are a **highly effective** way to re-engage users even when they’re not actively browsing your website.

Here’s why they’re powerful:

- 🖥️ **Browser-Based**: No app required — users just need a browser!
- 🔔 **Real-Time Engagement**: Deliver time-sensitive updates and offers instantly.
- 📊 **High Visibility**: Notifications appear right on the user’s screen, boosting interaction.

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Campaign Creation

Follow these quick steps to launch your campaign:

### ✅ Step 1: Select Target Audience

Segment users based on:

- Behavior (e.g. added to cart, viewed product)
- Demographics (location, gender, etc.)
- Campaign interactions

➡️ Need help with segmentation? Check out [Creating Segment](./creating-segment.html)

---

### ✅ Step 2: Compose the Message

Write a compelling message that includes:

- **Title** and **Body Text**
- Optional **Hero Image** or **Icon**
- **Call to Action Button** (e.g., “Shop Now”)

🧠 Tip: Keep the message concise and value-driven!

---

### ✅ Step 3: Choose Trigger Type

You can send the Web Push via:

- 📅 One-Time Campaign
- 🧲 Triggered Campaign (e.g. when user adds to cart)
- 🔁 Recurring Campaign (e.g. every Monday)

---

### ✅ Step 4: Set Scheduling & Frequency

Choose when to send:

- ⏰ **Send Now** or schedule for later
- 📆 **Recurring Frequency** (Daily, Weekly, etc.)

🛡️ Avoid spamming: Set frequency capping to control how many notifications a user receives.

---

### ✅ Step 5: Preview & Launch

- Preview how the notification will look on **Chrome**, **Firefox**, etc.
- 🔍 Double-check targeting and content
- ✅ Click **Launch Campaign**

---

## 👁️ Campaign Overview

Once the campaign is live:

- Track **Delivery Rates**, **Click Rates**, and **Conversions**
