## ✉️ Let's Get You Started with Users

This guide is designed to help you understand **what users are**, how Jarvis identifies them, and how you can use that data to craft **personalized, high-impact experiences**.

---

### 👤 Who is a User?

> 📘 **Definition**  
> At Jarvis, anyone who has **interacted with your business at least once** is considered a **User**.  
> This includes visits to your mobile app, website, offline store, or any digital interaction.

**How does Jarvis detect users?**

Once your platforms (e.g., app, website, CRM) are connected to Jarvis, we begin **automatically tracking and collecting** basic user data in real-time.

You’ll find this data under:

- 🧾 **Users** – Basic user info like device, location, OS, etc.  
- 📊 **Events** – Actions like login, app open, purchases, etc.  

You can also **manually upload** historical or offline data via the **Data Management** section.

---

### 🕵️ Unknown and Known Users

Users are divided into two types:

- **Unknown Users** — Anonymous visitors
- **Known Users** — Identified by unique details like email, phone, or customer ID

Once a user shares this information, Jarvis **automatically upgrades them** from unknown to known.

---

### 🆔 Unique Identifier

A **Unique Identifier** helps Jarvis recognize each user individually — usually an email, phone number, or customer ID.

For example:

If you define `email` as the identifier, anyone who shares it becomes a **Known User**. Others remain **Unknown** until they provide it.

> 🚧 **Setup Tip**  
> Follow our _Identifying Users_ guide for step-by-step help.  
> 👨‍💻 Involve your tech team for smooth integration.

---

## 📌 User Attributes

User attributes help you build a **complete user persona** — from preferences to purchase habits.

There are two types:

---

### 🛠 System Attributes

Collected **automatically** by Jarvis:

- Location 🌍  
- OS and Device 📱💻  
- App version 🧮  
- Gender, DOB (if available) 🎂  

No extra work needed — we handle this!

---

### 🧩 Custom Attributes

**You define these**, based on what matters to your business. Examples:

- 🪙 Reward Points  
- 🆔 Loyalty Tier (Gold, Silver, etc.)  
- 📅 Subscription Renewal Date  
- 🛍 Customer Category

> 🚧 **Setup Tip**  
> Check our _technical documentation_ for adding custom attributes.  
> Again, this is best done with help from your developers.

---

## 📂 User Profiles

A **User Profile** is a detailed record of **every interaction and trait** of a user — whether known or unknown.

If a user shares an identifier later, Jarvis **merges their old anonymous data** with the new known profile — giving you a full 360° view.

---

### 1️⃣ Basic Information

Includes core info such as:

- 📇 Name, Email, Phone  
- 🕰 First Seen, Last Seen  
- 📍 Last Known Location  
- 📢 Acquisition Source  
- 📌 Campaign History  
- 🧩 Segments they belong to

---

### 2️⃣ Attributes

These are personal characteristics that shape user behavior:

- 🎂 Birthday  
- 👰 Marital Status  
- 🛍 Purchase History  
- 🪙 Reward Points  
- 🎓 Education  
- 🧬 Gender

---

### 3️⃣ Devices

Lists all devices the user used to interact:

- Web 💻  
- Android 🤖  
- iOS 🍏

Each device record includes:

- 🆔 Device ID  
- 🌐 Browser Info  
- 📊 Session Count  
- 🕓 First/Last Seen  

---

### 4️⃣ Channels

Channels = Touchpoints for your messages:

- 🔔 Push Notifications  
- 📱 In-App Messages  
- 💬 SMS  
- 📧 Email  
- 📊 Web Popups, Surveys

Track each user’s:

- 📡 Reachability  
- 📨 Messages Sent  
- 📈 Campaigns Received  
- ✅ Conversions  
- 🕓 Last Message Interaction

---

### 5️⃣ Events

> 🚧 **Want a deep dive into Events?**  
> Head over to our [_Events Guide_](./core-concepts-events.html)

Every action = an **event**. Think of these like footprints users leave behind.

Example events:

- 👀 View Product  
- 🛒 Add to Cart  
- ✅ Checkout  
- 🚪 Session Ended  

Each event includes:

- 🕓 Timestamp  
- 🌍 Location  
- 🖥 Browser
