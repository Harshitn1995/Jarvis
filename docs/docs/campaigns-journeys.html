                <p><strong> <em>Customer centricity. Targeted communication. Contextual experiences.
                            Customer delight. Personalized engagement...</em> </strong> As
                    marketers, we often come across these buzzwords in meetings, while surfing the
                    internet or checking up on our favorite marketing gurus. </p>
                <p>While you may come across these terms in various contexts, they all boil down to
                    the same thesis: <em>designing your engagement strategy around each user's
                        behavior and preferences.</em></p>
                <p>Building upon this premise, we created <strong>Journeys</strong> - a flexible,
                    logic-based tool that unifies all your channels of communication, helping you
                    deliver incredible experiences throughout a user's lifecycle. </p>

                <h3>What is a Journey?</h3>
                <p><em>A Journey is a wholesome experience that guides each user through the
                        various <a target="_self" href="user-engagement.html">stages of their
                            lifecycle</a> by engaging them in the right moment, with the most
                        relevant context, through their preferred channel.</em></p>
                <div class="interactive-section callout">
                    <p><strong>How?</strong> <em>Let us explain.</em></p>
                    <p>When a user interacts with your business through your app, website, or offline,
                        they perform various actions as they navigate their way to achieving a specific
                        goal. Depending on your business, these goals vary and could be anything like:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Placing an order</li>
                        <li>Purchasing a subscription</li>
                        <li>Signing up to avail your services/consume content</li>
                        <li>Learning a skill</li>
                        <li>Managing financial investments</li>
                        <li>Booking a travel package/ flights tickets/ hotel stays</li>
                        <li>Booking movie/ concert tickets </li>
                        <li>Purchasing fashion accessories/ gadgets/ home decor and so on.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In their journey to achieving these goals, each user experiences <a target="_self"
                            href="user-engagement.html">several stages</a>. However,
                        factors like a user's <em>device preferences, channel preferences, expectations
                            from your brand, spending habits, location, educational
                            qualifications...</em> invariably cause each user to experience your brand
                        differently. </p>
                    <p>Creating consistent brand experiences across channels and platforms is one of the
                        most prominent challenges marketers, like you and me, face today. <strong>This
                            is why we created <em>Journeys</em>.</strong> </p>

                <div class="interactive-section callout">
                    <p><strong>Each <em>Journey experience</em> can be designed using an
                            <em>If-this-happens-then-do-that</em> logic, helping you:</strong></p>
                    <ul>

                                informational/promotional content can help them proceed to the next

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Spread out the experience over a period of time (because we don't want to
                                be too pushy, right?)</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Contextually personalize each user's experience to their behavior,
                                preferences, location and real-time interactions with your app, website,
                                and campaigns.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Let's go over a use-case to show you how it works:</p>
                </div>

                <div class="interactive-section callout">
                    <h2>👍 Creating a Journey to Motivate Users to Complete Their Purchase (E-commerce)</h2>
                    <p>Let's take the example of an e-commerce platform (app + web) that exclusively
                        deals in fashion wear and accessories. </p>
                    <p>They recently launched multiple holiday season offers on their platforms in a
                        bid to drive sales and it worked brilliantly! Within a week, their
                        conversions were up by 2x. </p>
                    <p>But, there was also a problem.</p>
                    <p>Stats indicated that a high share of users added products to their cart but
                        failed to go through with the purchase. This is behavior is commonly
                        referred to as 'cart abandonment' and can easily be curbed with an effective
                        engagement strategy. </p>
                    <p>And this is exactly what marketers of the platform decided to do! </p>
                    <p><strong>Here's how they planned the <em>Journey experience</em>:</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Cart Abandonment</p>
                    <p><strong>End Goal:</strong> Purchase</p>
                    <p><strong>Target Audience:</strong> All users who add products to cart but
                        don't purchase</p>
                    <p><strong>Plan:</strong> Offer users an additional 10% off on their entire
                        purchase and a cashback too, if necessary. </p>
                    <p><strong>Strategy:</strong> Specifically engage non-purchasing users with a
                        series of messages, spread out over 2 days. </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <em>How?</em> - Observe the purchase behavior of all users who add
                            products to cart, for a day.
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Then engage all users who haven't made a purchase with a
                                    personalized <em>Push Notification</em> offering 10% off!

                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    We'll observe the purchase behavior of all users who received
                                    the discount offer for a day and nudge non-purchasers
                                    through the same offer, but via <em>Email.</em>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Then, we'll wait for another day to see if these users make a
                                    purchase. If not, then we'll make one last attempt at
                                    motivating them with 10% off + cashback and cease
                                    communication.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            <em>Where?</em> - <em>Push Notifications</em> and <em>Email.</em>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    </li>

                <h3>Step 2: Identify the
                    End Goal
                </h3>
                <p><em>Ask yourself, why do you want to build the Journey experience? What returns
                        will it generate?</em></p>

                <h3>Step 3: Identify the Target Audience
                </h3>
                <p><em>Ask yourself, who is at the root of the challenge you're facing?</em></p>

                    Step 5: Build the Strategy
                </h3>
                <p>We'll combine answers to the statements from <em>Step 1</em> to <em>Step 4</em>
                    to build a viable engagement strategy on the <em>Canvas.</em> We've broken down
                    <em>Journey experience</em> strategy into two parts:
                </p>
                <p><strong>Part 1: How do you plan on engaging your users?</strong></p>
                <p>Dig into the stats of your previous campaigns, cohorts, funnels and other CRM
                    data to identify the most viable tone and method to initiate a conversation with
                    your users (and keep it going over a long period!) Once you have the insights,
                    ask yourself: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Will you appeal to the user's emotions?</li>
                    <li>Will you incentivize the user's actions by offering a discount?</li>
                    <li>Will you reinforce the value proposition of your brand by showcasing how it
                        has benefited other users?</li>
                    <li>Will you engage users in the context of their behavioral history and
                        preferences to achieve your goals?</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Part 2: Where do you plan to engage your users?</strong></p>
                <p>Identify the most viable channels of engagement that will help you meet your
                    goals. When doing so, ask yourself:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Does the user journey span across various platforms (app, web, offline
                        store)? </li>
                    <li>Which channels do my users prefer to connect with my brand?
                        <ul>
                            <li>This could include any or a combination of <em><a target="_self"
